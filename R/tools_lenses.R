#        Lenses
#
#
# This is an experimental implementation of the lens data types for Kea.
# Ideally, they will take Kea from being awesome for flat or simple collections
# to being awesome for more complex record-type data.
#
# Just a test for now, all syntax is undecided and all abstractions may be
# re-abstracted.

# People like references. Ditch the lens metaphor, and just call lenses
# 'functional references'.
