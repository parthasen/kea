-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-

Enhancements:

* xSelect, xPartition & xReject now preserve collection names.

Bug-Fixes:

* Summation of character-vectors now includes the number of NA values in
the input.

* named NA is na.

* Summation of incorrect arguments now corrently handles NA values in vectors.

* Infinite values are now included as whole numbers during argument summation.

* Num now checks and fails if its argument is Na.

* is_collection is now false for factors.

Documentation:

* Corrected type signature of xExplode.

Package Internals:

* Added worksWhen element to grammar.

* Added forall-next tests for xTake and xDrop.

* is_na and elem_is_na is now true for named NA elements.






Kiwi 0.28.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-26

Improved handling of string corner-cases.

Bug-Fixes:

* Incorrect arguments to 'rexp' parametre now throws a useful
error when it is not a collection.

* 'num' now checks and fails if its argument is NaN.

* Regular expressions are now validated before use, and throw
clear errors if invalid.

* Regular expressions throw a clear error if NA is provided.

* Arguments matching 'str', 'str1', and 'str2' may no longer be NA.

Package Internals:

* Added macros must-be-non-na, must-be-non-nan, must-not-contain-na.

* Added function to validate regular expressions.








Kiwi 0.27.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-26

Improvements to numeric corner-cases, bug-fixes, and speedups.

Enhancements:

* xCompose no longer collects its arguments: this means that
xCompose_(identity) is now identical to identity.

* xOrderOf now returns indices that sort in increaing order, for
consistency with xSortBy.

* xOrderOf now throws an error for NA and NaN input, as they
are unorderable.

* xRankOf now throws an error for NA and NaN input, as they
are unorderable.

* xOrderOf is now faster.

Bug-Fixes:

* fns parametre arguments now correctly reassigned after function lookup.

* Type conversion of any na to any other na is now allowed.

* xCycle now fails when trying to cycle infinitely far.

* xRepeat now throws a clear error when trying to repeat infinitely.

* Removed second, redundant type conversion from xAs* family of functions,
which should increase performance.

* xChoose no longer fails for length-zero numbers.

Package Internals:

* Added must-be-finite, must-be-orderable macros.

* Added a forall-next test to xAt, xChoose, xCompose, xJuxtapose,
xNotNa, xIsNull, xOrderOf, xRankOf, xStopWatch, xThread.

* Renamed 'when' to 'holdsWhen'.

* Devectorised is_na.








Kiwi 0.26.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-24

Added two new functions, fixed a bug in input validation.

Enhancements:

* Added xIndicesOf, which that returns the indices of a collection.

* Added xKeysOf, which returns the names of a collection.

* Removed '%of%', one of two infix composition operators. Calls to
%then% are easier to read.

Bug Fixes:

* the parametre 'fns' ands 'colls' now correctly validates its input;
previously it did not check if its argument was a collection of functions
or function names.

* A temporary variable created by the must-be-collection-of-fn-matchable
macro is now hidden.

Package Internals:

* Added forall-next tests for xIndicesOf.










Kiwi 0.25.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-20

Removed several functions, made partially applied function throw better error messages.

Enhancements:

* Partially-applied functions give a clearer call when they throw an error, showing
 the name of the kiwi function that threw the error.

* xAtKey now throws an error if the input collection does not contain the required
key, rather than returning NULL.

* Removed xPluck, as it was simply a vectorised form of xAtKey, with the same task
better achieved by xMap(xAtKey()).

* Removed xSplitAt and xSplitWith, as their corner cases are currently unclear
 and they are largely untested. Decatenation functions will be reintroduced
 at a later date, though probably in a different form.

Bug Fixes:

* Fixed a bug in xRead; multiple lines are now correctly collapsed with the
newline character.

* Functions with the parametre 'fns' now checks that 'fns' is a collection.

Package Internals:

* Added a new macro for ensuring a collection's names contains a key.

* Added a forall-next test for xParamsOf.












Kiwi 0.24.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-18

Major internal update, changes corner-cases of most functions, removed two functions.

Enhancements:

* Renamed xInter to xInterOf, for consistancy with xUnionOf.

* Removed xRecycle, as it is now possible to recycle with xRepeat, xMap and xTake easily.

* Removed xReorder, as xSlice and xMap can reorder easily.

* Functions that take a number or string now treat numeric(0) or string(0) in a similar
manner to how collection functions return the empty collection. Conceptually, these atomic
inputs are treated like values in a Maybe type.

This is more logical than the previous behaviour of converting empty numbers or strings
to length-one values, but there are likely bad corner cases introduced in this release that
will be ironed out in the future.

* xAnyOf, ..., xNoneOf, xSelect, xReject, xPartition, xDropWhile,
xTakeWhile, xPoll, xSplitWith now throws an error if a non-boolean result is given by
an input predicate.

Bug Fixes:

* xChop and xChunk now respond useful errors for NaN values.

* Functions that require collections no longer accept factors.

* xJuxtapose no longer has the insane corner-case of returning the empty list
when supplied no functions; it now returns a function as it originally should have.

* xImplode no longer excludes length-zero or empty strings
from its input collection.

Documentation:

* Improved documentation of corner-cases.

Package Internals:

* Refactored macros into their own files; this should aid testing significantly.

* num, str...str2, rexp have their type-checking code automatically injected into
kiwi functions now.

* Added a forall-next test for xImplode












Kiwi 0.23.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-14

Improves arrow function, with speed improvements, bug-fixes, new features.

Enhancements:

* Arrow functions now support underscore parametres; any parametre with an underscore
suffix is automatically made into a kiwi object, and the underscores are removed from the parametre.

* xLambda is no longer directly exported, as kiwi is not a metaprogramming library
and there are no tests validating it works when directly called.

* Improved the performance of arrow functions, particularily for unary functions with no
underscores.

Bug Fixes:

* Arrow functions now correctly displays where its errors were raised from.

* Fixed a typo in arrow function error message.

* Errors are now thrown for duplicated parametres before the function is invoked.

* Removed unneeded call to `sys.call` in xCompose, which should speed up generated
functions significantly.

Documentation:

* Added an example to xChunk.

Package Internals:

* Added join_exprs, which joins two expressions into a single expression.












Kiwi 0.22.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-12

Improved performance of some functions significantly.

Enhancements:

* To simplify code injection, factors now have the corresponding
parametre 'fact' and matrices/data-frames the parametre 'tab'.

* Removed filtering of no-character strings from xToWords, xToLines, xToChars,
to keep in line with xImplode's recent change. Leading whitespaces ARE
still removed, though this may be modified in the future.

* Speedup of xArityOf, xAsVar, xAsVal, xIsVal, xVal, xShuffle, xUnspread,
and the wildcard operators x. $ and x. @.

* Minor speedup of functions that call 'unit_to_value' or 'as_typed_vector'.

* Method lookup is now slightly quicker.

Bug-Fixes:

* xIsVariadic of nullary functions is now logical(0), to be consistant
with other logical functions.

Documentation:

* Fixed a type of xToWords.

Package Internals:

* Simplified automatic precondition writing.

* The parametres nums, strs, ints, and bools now automatically inject
their boilerplate into their respective functions.

* Removed explicit use of strsplit, replacing it with str_split.

* Removed use of toString, for efficiencies sake now using paste.

* Added a forall-next test, testing if partial application works when
parametres are matched out-of-order.

* Added a forall-next test for xIsVariadic, xJoin.












Kiwi 0.21.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-11

An internal update, that adds automatic addition of argument-writing code.

Enhancements:

* Variadic functions are now more efficient.

Bug-Fixes:

* x_ now adds a newline before printing.

* Fixed a name collision in partially applied functions that affected
functions with a 'fn' parametre.

Package Internals:

* The Fix macro now injects argument-checking macros into a function
based on the parametre name, making it an ad-hoc type system.

* Removed most explicit calls to macro's from function definitions;
they are now automatically injected.

* Removed explicit function matching from functions with fn, pred or
fns parametres.

* Added forall-next test for partially-applied methods, xDropWhile,
xTakeWhile, xUnionOf, xWhere.

* Removed test for macros, since they are no longer written by hand.













Kiwi 0.20.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-10

Removed specialised reading/writing functions, adds xRead and xWrite.

Date: 2014-6-11

Enhancements:

* Added xRead, which reads a file as a single string.

* Added xWrite, which writes a single string to a file.

Documentation:

* Updated xAddKey examples to exploit partial application.













Kiwi 0.19.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-10

A minor update. Adds xLastAs, fixes a bug in xFirstAs...xFourthAs.

Date: 2014-6-10

Enhancements:

* Added xLastAs, which sets the last value of a collection.

Bug Fixes:

* xFirstAs ... xFourthAs could not be correctly partially-applied. This is fixed, and
a future version of Kiwi will guard against these errors.

Documentation:

Package Internals:

* Updated the xVal test to work correctly with Rscript testing commands;
tests now run correctly from the command line.

* Added Rscript to run a single unit test.

* Added a forall-next test for xGroupBy, xLastAs.












Kiwi 0.18.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-9

Adds further support for automatic partial application, adds mutator
functions & removed some vectorised functions.

Enhancements:

* Added automatic partial application to the variadic forms of functions.

* Added xAppend, xPrepend for inserting elements into a collection.

* Added xFirstAs, xSecondAs, xThirdAs, and xFourthAs. These functions set their
respective position in a collection to a value.

* xCycle no longer operates on collections of collections, instead on flat collections.
Partial application reduces the need for collection-of-collection functions, and simple
type signatures are more composable than complex ones.

* Removed xElemIs, xElemNot; partial application means that 'xMap(xIs(val))' works
perfectly well, eliminating the benefit of these functions.

* xExplode no longer removes length-zero elements produced on exploding; although
strsplit can introduce such elements spuriously, removing them can cause difficulties.
This may be addressed by not ussing strsplit internally in a future version.

* xFromChars, xFromWords, xFromLines no longer call xImplode internally, so error-messages
should be identified as coming from them, not xImplode.

Documentation:

* xByRowKeys documentation now correctly builds.

* Removed embarassing use of the word 'automatical' from README.

Package Internals:

* Testing tools can now be run from the command line, with colourised output. Some
tests currently break when run in this mode.

* MakeVariadic now inserts the 'Fix' macro into its generated functions.

* Wrote forall-next tests for xCycle, xAppend, xPrepend, xFirstAs, xSecondAs,
xThirdAs, xFourthAs, xUniqueOf.












Kiwi 0.17.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-7

Adds automatic partial application to every function in Kiwi. No tests are
currently breaking, but this feature likely interferes with error reporting.

Enhancements:

* Kiwi functions are now partially-appliable; not all arguments need to be
provided at once. This is an important milestone. Errors are no longer thrown
for missing inputs for this reason.

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed a bug that crashed error handing due to improper conversion of a
function to a string during error message creation.

Package Internals:

* Added fix, a variant of xFix required for efficient partial application of
internal functions.

* Added Fix, a macro added to functions that need to be partially applied.

* Fixed an incorrect definition of test_negative; now correctly applies case
to property.

* Removed test for the missing macro, since this is no longer needed.

* Added unit tests for xFirstOf, xFourthOf, xIsNan, xIsTrue, xList, xLocate,
xNotNan, xOneOf, xPoll, xReject, xSecondOf, xThirdOf, xUnit, xUnspread,
xUnzipIndices, and xUnzipKeys.

* Added inject_expr, which inserts a line into the head of an expression body.
Currenty untested.












Kiwi 0.16.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-7

A very minor update. Renamed library from it's working name (Arrow) to
a final name (Kiwi), refactored internals.

Documentation:

* Removed non-ascii characters from documentation (lambda, epsilon).

* Renamed method-only function's title from $ xMethod to xMethod.

* Rewrote readme.

Package Internals

* Refactored forall-next to remove code duplication.

* forall-next now works correctly for negative tests.

* added additional tests for forall-next itself.

* added negative test to xAt.

* added tests to xChunk, xDo, xMap, xSelect.












Kiwi 0.15.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-5

This release adds some rigourous tests to kiwi, and fixes several bugs.

Bug-Fixes:

* xChop called with Inf now returns a list of length-one lists, instead of
converting its input to a list.

* xNoneOf now detects whether not-any result was true, instead of not-any.

Documentation:

* Fixed a broken roxygen tag in xElemsByCols.

Package Internals:

* Added forall-next tests for xAllOf, xAnyOf, xArityOf, xCapture, xChop,
xFalsity, xFirstOf, xIdentity, xIrrelevance, xIsEmpty, xIsFalse, xIsTrue,
xNoneOf, xNotEmpty, xPoll, xReject, xSecondOf, xTabulate, xThirdOf,
xTruth, xVersion, xZip and xZipKeys.












Kiwi 0.14.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-5

This version removes xVectorise and xGraft, and cleans up the method code.

Enhancements:

* Added xUnit_, a variadic form of xUnit.

* The method $ xExecute now passes its left-hand side self argument to its
anonymous function (the lambda was previous zero-argument).

* Removed xVectorise/xVectorize; future versions of Kiwi will include
automatic partial application (or at the very least pre-currying), so
vectorise will become redundant.

* Removed xGraft, which allowed custom methods to be added to the kiwi
call chain. It was untested, unusued, and barely more useful than xTap.

Documentation:

* Added missing parametre documentation for x__ (its ... argument).

Bug-Fixes:

* xExecute & xTap now performs function lookup on its input function/string argument.
For example, xTap('mean') will now call xTap with the mean function.

* Fixed potential error in xByRows, xByCols for empty matrices/data.frames. Now returns
the empty list for that case.

Package Internals:

* Moved all functions only available as methods into their own files,
instead of having direct definitions in x_.R. This aids code uniformity & testing.

* forall-next can now take multiple descriptions, and has improved error reporting for
positive failures.

* changed describe from an overriding field to a joining field in the forall-next tools.

* factored prototype inheritance into a function.

* Removed errant in-prototype definitions of xThread; now uses the method-adding
function.

* added forall-next tests for x_

* renamed make_formals to as_formals, removed the 'as_parametres' alias for as_formals

* removed join-env, is_fn_matchable; neither was ever called by kiwi.












Kiwi 0.13.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-2

A mostly internal update, removes two quantifier functions and adds x__.

Enhancements:

* Added x__, the variadic form of x_.

* Removed xExists and xForall; the addition of xAnyOf and xAnyOf is equivalent
for most cases, and for the remaining cases (polyadic functions) using xProdSetOf
and a quantifier is identical, and favours composition.

Documentation:

* Added examples to xAddKeys, xByLevels, xChoose, xElemNot, xIsMember, xNotTrue,

Bug-Fixes:

* xOneOf now throws an error for an empty collection, as it is impossible to
return any elements in this case.

* Factors passed to x_ now get assigned the correct set of methods; previously
they were given collection methods, as factors are technically collections.

Package Internals:

* Seperated the next forall tool into modules, fixed several bugs. The tool is now
effective for simple test cases, but more work is required for negative tests.

* Added new-style tests to xIs, xNot, xOneOf.

* Simplified the '+.xforall' method with higher-order functions.











Kiwi 0.12.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-28

A major but mostly internal update; upgraded testing tools and removed dangerous
function calls.

A major but mostly internal update; upgraded testing tools and removed dangerous
function calls.

Enhancements:

* Added 'all empty' and 'any empty' property tests to value summation for lists,
and dimension reporting for data frames.

* Added property tests for inner kiwi objects in summated lists.

* Removed special handling of NA's from xElemIs and xElemNot, but this may be
re-implemented in the future.

* Removed the x_ method from Kiwi, since x_Identity does the same thing
in a more obvious way.

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed missing spaces in error messages produced by incorrectly typed vectors.

* Simplified behaviour of xIsNan, xNotNa, xNotNan, xIsNan, potentially
correcting issues for non length-one vectors.

* Removed use of sample, potetentially fixing bugs with numeric vectors.

Documentation:

* Added example for xElemIs, xLocate, xReadChars, xReadLines, xReadwords,
xRestOf, xParamsOf.

* Removed redundant @method tags from documentation.

Package Internals:

* Added a rigourous test for example length, file existence, function calls
to dangerous functions, and for missing 'missing' functions, and removed an
older similar test suite.

* Implemented a new testing tool for Kiwi, which should give more complete
test coverage and both positive and negative controls. The syntax is also
improved. xSelect currently uses this tool exclusively, and its use will be
expanded in future versions.

* Added a simple test for the new forall tool, though more are needed.

* Removed direct use of is.na; the function can fail for null values, and
testing functions should never fail. Further testing functions will be wrapped
or removed at a later date.

* Removed direct use of sample, as the function has a bizzare corner case
for length-one number vectors.

* Added elem_is_na and elem_is_nan, to replace the use of is.na and
is.nan for vectors.

* Removed direct use of is.atomic and is.list, replacing them with functions that
fix their null corner case.

* Added a minor fix to ith_suffix corner case which now supports infinite
values, in the unlikely case they will arise.

* throw_kiwi_warning now actually throws a warning, not an error. The function
was not used, so no bug fixes are required.











Kiwi 0.11.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-19

Removes several data frame and matrix methods, and adds many examples.

Enhancements:

* Removed xColUnit, xRowUnit, xFullUnit. Although theoretically useful
they were largely untested and unused. May be added in future if genuinely needed.

* Removed xTranspose. Kiwi as a policy does not support matrices and data frames,
only their conversion to other types. There are effective ways to transpose lists
in Kiwi already.

Bug-Fixes:

* Added xCapture alias xK to the methods avaiable to all values. More rigourous
tests will be added in future to avoid missing methods.

* xByColkeys & xByRowkeys for matrices now return character vectors.

Documentation:

* Fixed type signature of xPluck, xRepeat.

* Added example to (or improved example for):
xAddKeys, xAllOf, xAsCharacter, xAsComplex,
xAsDouble, xAsInteger, xAsLogical, xCapture, xChunk, xDeepMap,
xDelay, xElemsByCols, xElemsByRows, xExecute, xFix, xFormalsOf,
xFromChars, xIsFalse, xIsMatch, xLift, xLocate, xMinBy, xNoneOf,
xNotEmpty, xNotFalse, xNotMember, xNotNan, xNotNull, xPartition,
xShuffle, xSlice, xThread, xToChars, xUniqueOf,

* Added details to xByRows.

* Html-escaped docs for xToChars, xToLines, xToWords.

Package Internals:

* Added tests for xIsSubset, xNotSubset.

* Added tests for xNegate.

* Added .babelignore, to allow easier random access of useful kiwi files.

* Added rsample, which corrects a bad length-one corner case in sample. Will
remove direct use of sample from kiwi in future. Bugs caused by sample may
come to light in the next release.











Kiwi 0.10.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-16

Removes the xElemIs*, xElemNot* and xReject* family of functions,
replacing them with the more generix xElemIs and xElemNot.

Enhancements:

* Added xElemIs and xElemNot. These functions test each element of a
collection for equality to a value.

* Renamed xIsNot to xNot, for consistency with the other predicate names
in Kiwi.

* Removed xElemIsFalse, xElemIsNa, xElemIsTrue, xElemNotFalse, xElemNotNa,
xElemNotTrue, xElemIsNull, xElemIsNan, xElemNotNan, xElemNotNull,
xRejectNa, xRejectNan, xRejectNull, xRejectEmpty. The rational for this
is that kiwi emphasises compositionality, and each case these functions solve
can easily be done with other functions. This reduces the number of tests and
documentation to be maintained significantly.

Bug-Fixes:

* xByColkeys and xByRowkeys now return character vectors.

Documentation:

* Added large example to xFix.

* Clarified/corrected return values of xWrite* family of functions.

* Corrected type signatures of xMinBy and xMayBy.

* Corrected return value of xByColkeys.

* Clarified xFromChars' description.

* Added minor details to xIsMatch.

* Added example to xByCols and xByRows.

* Added example to xNotNa.

* Added example to xNotNan.

* Removed non-parsing example from xUnzipIndices.

* Added example to xUnzipIndices.

* Extended xUnit's example.

Package Internals:

* Removed unevaluated check for kiwi objects in one case
of as_typed_vector's if condition.

* Added test to xUnionOf.











Kiwi 0.9.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-12

This release adds xIsNot, improves documentation.

Enhancements:

* added xIsNot, a complement to xIs.

* Improved error messages provided when converting vector types;
if an kiwi object is supplied (accidentally) this is stated.

* Implemented basic object summarisation for data frames (upon error).

Bug-Fixes:

* xAtCol now attempts to container type-convert its numeric input "num".

Documentation:

* Added details and corner cases to xAtCol.

* Added details to xUnzipIndices.

* Added corner cases section to xAsComplex, xAsCharacter.

* Clarified a corner case in xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf.

Package Internals:

* added fromStream, part of the testing tool in development.
* throw_kiwi_error can now be called without a call argument.
* forall will now correctly report errors; previously the argument order was backwards.












Kiwi 0.8.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-11

This release drastically improves the appearance of error messages.

Enhancements:

* improved the appearance of error messages; they now take up less space.

* for error-causing lists, two new properties are displayed in the error:
'is nested' and 'all nested'.

Package Internals:

* renamed propeties of summate to use whitespace instead of underscores.

* as_typed_vector and as_atom are now more documented, and slightly more efficient.

* refactored back end to remove older error-message containing like exclaim and lament,
in favour of in-place definitions.

* removed maybe_atomic & newline

* used as_parameters in MakeVariadic, to avoid code duplication.











Kiwi 0.7.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-10

A mostly internal release, renamed Any, xNone, to xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf.

Enhancements:

* Renamed xAll, xAny, xNone, to xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf. This complies better
with Kiwi's naming conventions.

* Functions that require collections, functions, or collections of functions
will now inform the user if they were (accidentally) given an kiwi object.

Documentation:

* Added more accurate desciption to the xAs* family of container converters.

* Escaped most special characters in type signatures; html documentation will now
render correctly in most cases.

* Minor updates to the readme.

Package Internals:

* Deprecated and removed assert, moving over to the more flexible
functions throw_kiwi_error and throw_kiwi_warning.

* Added extensive tests for xUnzipIndices.

* Added test to ensure xJoin always returns a list.











Kiwi 0.6.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-7

Added xNotSubset, renamed xNot and removed xAsClosure.

Enhancements:

* Added xNotSubset, to complement the function xIsSubset.

* Renamed xNot to xNegate, to allow for a complement to be added to xIs.

* Removed xAsClosure; the function had very minimal likely use-cases,
and did not work for every primitive function.

Package Internals:

* Removed a lot of dead code (mostly error message code).

* Added tests to xElemIs_ functions.

* Made stringify_call more robust.

* Commented xList code extensively.












Kiwi 0.5.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

A feature-rich version; adds three new functions for testing equality
and match/mismatch against a regular expression.

Enhancements:

* Added xIs; a function for testing if values are identical.

* Added xIsMatch; tests if a string matches a regular expression.

* Added xNotMatch; tests if a string doesn't match a regular expression.

Bug-Fixes:

* renamed xAddKeys... to xAddKeys_, to keep in step with other variadic
methods.

Documentation:

* Added example for xIs.

Package Internals:

* Added tests for xIs, xIsMatch, xNotMatch.











Kiwi 0.4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

This version adds xNone and a logo, and fixes an important bug in error-reporting
functions (no irony whatsoever).

Enhancements:

* Added xNone; the antonym of xAllOf. It completes the set of functions
xAllOf (does every element match a predicate?), xAnyOf (does any element match a predicate?)
and now xNone (does no value match a predicate?).

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed an issue in reporting of missing arguments (and possibly other exceptions). The
name of the argument for which an error is thrown is now displayed properly.

Documentation:

* Added a prototype logo for Kiwi!

* Added details section to xMap, explaining the basic concept of map.

* Added details section to xVersion, explaining the semantic versioning standard.

* Added example for xLastOf.

Package Internals:

* Fixed broken link tags in header of staticdocs head file.

* Added contact page (though jQuery) to staticdocs site.

* dQuote now lazily captures its argument.

* added tests for xNone.










Kiwi 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-3

A bug-fix release.

Enhancements:

* Very slightly improved xProdSetOf's efficiency by changing an inner Map
to lapply.

Bug-Fixes:

* Fixed a bug in as_method, in which variadic methods were not being generated
due to the use of an outdated regular expression to test whether the input function
was variadic.

* Type-errors in functions that take collections (xExplode for example) now report
the user-facing function they were thrown from.

* Fixed corner-case for xOneOf; if given a length one vector it extracts the value
from its collection (if it is a list).

Documentation:

* Added most missing type signatures to function docs.
* Added several missing titles to function docs.

Package Internals:

* as_atom and as_typed_vector now use the parent call
(sys.call(-1)) in error reports.

* Added test to check that every function has a type signature and title.











Kiwi 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-2

A minor release, mostly housekeeping and repaying technical debt.

Bug-Fixes:

* the xAsComplex, xAsInteger... family of functions now support conversion
of lists that contain NA values of any mode, at the cost of some performance.

* xLambda now checks that ':' is used as a parametre delimiter;
previously several infix functions could be used.

Documentation:

* type signatures added to several more function's documentation.

Package Internals:

* internal function `MakeVariadic` used to generate variadic forms of
functions, which should help avoid bugs in their definitions.

* eliminated most error-message functions, in favour of in-place
definitions and macros. This removed a lot of unneeded code.

* internal function `unit_to_value` now supports complex values.
