Kea 0.77.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2015-01-24

Removed xByLevels, xElemsByRows, xElemsByCols.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed xByLevels, xElemsByRows, xElemsByCols; they were flagged for removal, as
kea's data frame functions don't work well.

* Removed x. @ <value>, as it didn't work correctly. All other wildcard methods should
work.

BUG-FIXES:

* xFix now throws an explicit error for primitive functions, closing #102.

* xCycle no longer fails for length-zero number, closing #101.










Kea 0.76.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2015-01-18

Major reduction in number of unhandled exceptions thrown by Kea for unusual input.

NOTE:

* The version number for v0.75.0 seems to be erroneously set to v0.74.0.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed xByCols, xByRows, and xByValues, closing #100. These functions were flagged
for deletion a long time ago, as were most functions that operate on dataframes and
matrices.

* Failed attempts to lookup a function by string name or symbol now produce
more precise, idiomatic error messages.

BUG-FIXES:

* xChoose now checks for NA inputs, closing #99.

* xChunk now checks for length-zero inputs, closing #98.

* xFlatten now checks for na inputs, closing #97.

* Vector-related type errors are now labelled as type errors.

* xIndicesTo now checks that its argument is non-na, non-nan, closing #96.

* xRecycle now fails properly for length-zero arguments, closing #95.

* xSlice now fails cleanly for NaN values due to the improved Must_Be_Whole macro,
closing #94.

* xStopwatch now checks to see if its argument is NaN, closing #93.

* xTake now checks to see if its argument is NA, closing #92.

* xToWords, xToLines, xToChars now check if their argument is non-nan, closing #91.

* xZipKeys now adds text labels to its errors, closing #90.

* xAtKey now checks that its key argument is non-na, closing #88.

* xAt now explicitly checks its index is in bounds of the input collection, closing #87.

* xAt no longer throws errors for list(NaN) due to the improved Must_Be_Whole macro,
closing #86.

* Functions that have the parametre 'ints' or 'strs' now check that argument to see if
it is a collection, closing #85.

* Closed #84 (no actual associated bug).

* Failures to lookup a function name as an actual function will now throw an explicit
error, closing #83.

* A serious bug in partial application - where examples like xLift(.Primitive('<')) would
fail - is now fixed, closing #82.

* Kea now explicitely throws an exception when looking up a variable name
with more than ten-thousand bytes, closing #81.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added Must_Be_Index_Of macro, to check if a number is an index of a collection.

* Must_Be_Whole now performs a NaN check.

* The rcpp error handler can now throw exceptions of any kea subclass.

* grasp no longer takes a callback, as R is not JavaScript and there was no
advantage to this behaviour.

* Added match_fn, which performs the lookup step for function names in Kea.










Kea 0.75.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-12-16

Renamed xProdSetOf to xCross, removed xLimits.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed xProdSetOf to xCross, closing #80.

* Improved the efficiency of partial application. Closes #79.

* Removed xLimit, since it was at odds with Kea's focus as a collection library,
was side effectual, and had a rare use-case.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added a much improved docopt buildscript, which should aid future development.








Kea 0.74.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-12-13

Improved performance of lambda functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improved the efficiency of unary lambda functions x4.

* Renamed xUnit to xClear; xClear is a verb, a standard name for the operation
in other languages, and isn't confused with the unit of the values in a collection.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Improved the explanation of how the xAs* functions work.

* Added and modernised multiple examples.









Kea 0.73.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-12-12

Fixed performance bug in xZip.

BUG-FIXES:

* More thorough benchmarking showed that rewriting xZip in C++ slowed it down
significantly. This version reverts to the original R version, increasing performance by over an order of magnitude. Closes #74.









Kea 0.72.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-12-11

Improved documentation, lambda function performance.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improved the performance of xLambda.

* xLift had its uncertain status removed.

* Removed xByColkeys and xByRowkeys; Kea's dataframe support is really
bad and is being phased out in favour of an eventual new implementation.

BUG-FIXES:

* xExclude now has a roxygen export tag. Added a manual test to root out similar issues. Closes #77.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Moved an irrelevant example for reduce to other functions.

* Improved the documentation for xLift.

* Added example for xLift and xZip.

* Modernised the palindrome example to use xIntersect instead of xSelect(xIsIn)








Kea 0.71.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-12-8

Improved xInvoke, fixed several bugs.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* All Kea's C++ now uses the R_len_t type instead of the int type, so functions
are no longer necessarily tied to the 2^31 - 1 length limit imposed by integers. Closes #72.

* Removed xTap; xInvoke now takes an arbitrary value instead of a collection, so xTap
is no longer needed.

* Functions that employ short-circuiting now explicitly inform the user if they
attempt to use Return in an inner call. Closes #53.

BUG-FIXES:

* Removes an accidentally included variable in a macro that checks for finiteness, so xCycle
and similar functions will fail correctly when given an infinite value.

* xInvoke now labels any errors thrown by its input function correctly.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Re-implemented Kea's exception handling system to aid testing.










Kea 0.70.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-11-25

Added xMedianBy, updated testing internals.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xMedianBy, a function for getting the median of a collection by a
measure function.

* Removed xAsDataFrame. While collection <=> dataframe conversions are needed in Kea,
their current implementation is very poor. A well thought out replacement will be
implemented in the future.

BUG-FIXES:

* Added xExclude_ as a package export; last release the documentation was
not rebuild.

* Actually fixed type signature for xIntersect, for the same reasons as above.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Added new testing predicates.

* Renamed 'describe' to 'it'.

* Added unit test and integration test labelling functions.

* Added new benchmarks.

* Moved more tests over to the new predicate style.

* Added new unit tests and integration tests.










Kea 0.69.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-11-24

Added xExclude, improved set functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xExclude, which removes elements from a collection if they are not also in a
second collection. Closes #52.

* xIntersect now uses its first collection as a set, and draws values from its second. This
is more in line with kea's tactic of using leftmost parametres for flags, control arguments,
and specialising arguments and the later parametres for data. This is a breaking change.

* xIntersect now preseves the names of its second collection.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed type signature for xIntersect.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Improved the tests for xIntersect substantially.








Kea 0.68.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-11-24

Added xInvoke, removed old adaptor functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xInvoke, a function similar to xApply.

* Removed xSpread and xUnspread; since kea became partially applied by default
they became pretty useless. xApply and xInvoke cover all use cases of those
two functions (and additional use cases) with no syntax overhead. Closes #54.

* Removed xChop; it had an off-by-one error that was difficult to fix and it didn't
have a well-defined use case. Closes #68.

* Slightly improved the performance of xCompose for large numbers of input functions.

BUG-FIXES:

* Partial application now works as expected for variadic functions, instead of
returning a partially applied version of the non-variadic form. Closes #51.

* NaN and Na testing functions now never return named arguments.

* Fixed uninformative error upon encountering NA values in xFromLines and other string
functions, closing #70.

* xIsNan, xNotNan now return true for named NA arguments.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Implemented predicate composition to build predicates for use in testing, along
with many standard predicates. This should make writing and maintaining tests easier.
Only a small portion of test predicates have been ported over to the new system so far.

* Internal NA and NaN checking functions now explicitely remove names from their
output, making them safe for use with isTRUE.










Kea 0.67.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-11-8

Improved the performance of several functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Make xScan marginally faster.

* Made xTruth, xFalsity, and xIrrelevance for consistency. This reduces performance,
but consistency is worth more than speed.

* Removed unneeded truth checks from xIsFalse, xIsMatch, xIsNa, xIsNan, xIsNull,
xNotFalse, xNotMatch, xNotNa, xNotNan, xNotNull, xNotTrue.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed a regression causing untyped errors and warning thrown by kea to be labelled
with a call.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Added a fallback method for downloading kea to circumvent a dependency issue
in lib2git, closing #66.
















Kea 0.66.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-11-7

Improved the performance of higher-order functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improved the performance of xCompose, xFold, xIterate, xReduce, xScan,
xThread by ~x3. These makes kea much faster on the whole.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed a regression in error handling; error messages no longer include an
unformatted call.

* Fixed an incorrectly called exception in lambda functions.

EXAMPLES:

* Updated xReverse example to use xLenOf.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Fixed xAnyOf and xAllOf benchmarks.

* Removed unused benchmark code.
















Kea 0.65.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-11-3

Improved the efficiency of xDo.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improved efficiency of xDo by an order of magnitude.

BUG-FIXES:

* Lambda functions of the the form (1) := {} now throw an error.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Closed #65: benchmarks now correctly unload old versions of kea.

* Closed #63: benchmarks now begin with a setup expression to create test-data
for the benchmarks.

* Added a build script to generate empty files, tests and snippets.

* Added new benchmarks.

* Added new tests to xLambda to reduce the number of reversions.















Kea 0.64.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-10-29

Added xRecycle and typed exceptions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xRecycle, which recycles elements in a collection up to a fixed length.

* Kea now throws subtyped errors (like io_error, value_error and so on), which
should make it easy to create special error handlers for them.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed mislabelled parameter in xIntersect docs.

* Removed kea's github page and related code.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Reduced code duplication in kea's error system, and added error sub-classes.

* Simplified lambda function code, though there are currently some known
issues with parametre parsing.

* Added a code benchmarking script that measures performance over old versions.

* Added one-off test case testing functions, and removed the old stopgap implementations.

* Removed scripts to execute all kea tests, as they didn't work well.

* params_of now returns a pairlist.















Kea 0.63.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-10-20

Improved the performance of predicate functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed xDelay, as it is a side-effectful function with a side-effect not
required by any other function in kea.

* Made xSelect, xReject take roughly 36% the time per-iteration as in v0.62.0,
with similar gains for xAllOf, xAnyOf, xDropWhile, xLocate, xNoneOf, xPoll, and xTakeWhile.

* Made type-checking marginally faster (on the order of a few percent).

DOCUMENTATION:

* Replaced html special characters with ascii, so type signatures should be more readable
when R documentation is opened from the command line.

BUG-FIXES:

* xLocate now throws an error when its predicate returns a non-logical value.

* Added missing partial application and type-checking to xAmend and xGather, and audited the rest
of the code base for the same issue.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed unneeded braces from code; while stylistically unpleasant this saves about 200ns per function
call, which helps offset the expense of partial application.















Kea 0.62.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-10-17

Removed list comprehensions and immutable values.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed the immutable value functions xVal, xAsVal, xAsVar, and xIsVal, as they
had too much overhead to use.

* Removed xAsList, as it wasn't performant or more expressive than regular
Kea code.

* Made type-checking marginally more performant.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed a potential issue in functions that check for NA values in vectors; NaN is no
longer considered NA by some vector functions.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed unneeded expressions in type-checking macros.

* Made is_na and is_nan much more efficient.








Kea 0.61.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-10-15

Vastly improved the efficiency of partial application.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Functions are now much more performant (~3x slower than base, and about x37 faster than v0.60.0)
when partially applying a function with zero arguments.

* Calling a unary function with all its arguments is more performant: ~x3 slower than base, x49
faster than v0.60.

* The general mechanism for partial application is about x10 faster than v0.60.0.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Added functions for working with one-off test cases.







Kea 0.60.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-10-13

Added xRelate, xGather.

KNOWN ISSUES:

* xFlatten never worked correctly, but v0.60.0 partially reimplements it in C++.
xFlatten currently flattens collections to a single list, rather than allowing
the depth to be recur be set. This will be added in the near future.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xRelate, which is similar to xMap but returns the pre-image and image. Written in C++.

* Added xGather, a function that groups adjecent equal elements into sublists. Written in C++.

* Made small improvements to C++ kea functions in memory efficiency and speed.

BUG-FIXES:

* The str method for kea objects is now actually exported.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed experimental flags from xRiffle and xSwap, as they are likely to be kept.







Kea 0.59.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-10-1

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Implemented a method 'str' for kea functions.

* Improved memory efficiency of C++ kea functions.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* sym parametre is no longer required for MakeFun, which will make it easy to
implement partially applicable lambdas.








Kea 0.58.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-24

Removed xIsVariadic.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed xIsVariadic; it was never used, and it had an unclear corner case.

NOTE:

* v0.57.0 was accidentically labelled as v0.56.0, so this version was released quickly.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Implemented xProdSetOf in C++, closing #32. Currently too slow to use.






Kea 0.57.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-23

Improved xIsInfix, xNotInfix performance.

NOTE:

* Do not use this version, as the version numbers are broken. Instead, use
v0.58.0 or v0.56.0.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Rewrote xIsInfixOf in C++, yielding a x30 times speedup when
testing if 1...10,000 is a subsequence of itself.

* The functions %or%, %and% now short-circuit.

* Method suggestion now suggests using a variadic method when appropriate,
closing #48.

* Renamed xSliceString to xCarve; no other functions use the
string suffix, and I don't want to attach it to every string function.

* Removed the variadic form of xCarve, since only the
last argument may be variadic. Closes #49.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* MakeVariadic now fails if an attempt is made to fix anything but the
last parametre.

* Implemented Must_Be_Flag in C++.

* Rewrote xPoll and xScan in C++, but they are currently slower than equivalent
R so they aren't exported.

* Added tests for xLift, xLambda.








Kea 0.56.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-21

Improved the set functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed xInterOf to xIntersect, as the latter is a verb.

* Renamed xUniqueOf to xDistinctOf, for mathematical correctness.

* Renamed xUnionOf to xUnite, as the latter is a verb.

* xIntersect now takes two arguments, like the other set functions.

* xUnite now takes two arguments, like the other set functions.

* Rewrote xIntersect in C++, fixing an important issue (see below).

BUG-FIXES:

* xIntersect now works for finding the intersection of arbitrary non-vector
sets, closing #44

* xGroupBy now labels errors thrown by its input functions.








Kea 0.55.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-20

Removed self-references, improved performance.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed the self-reference system added in v0.48.0. Unfortunately this system
was too buggy and too slow, but a similar feature may be added in a more rigourous way
in the future.

* Renamed xIsSubset, xNotSubset to xIsSubsetOf, xNotSubsetOf, for consistency with the rest of kea.

* Rewrote xIsSubsetOf and xNotSubsetOf in C++. yielding a x60 speedup when
checking if 1...1000 with itself.

* Rewrote xIsSuffixOf, xIsPrefixOf, xNotSuffixOf, xNotPrefixOf, yielding an x30 speedup for 10,000 elements.

* Rewrote xGroupBy in C++, yielding a similar speedup to that of xTabulate.

* Rewrote xPowerSetOf in C++.

BUG-FIXES:

* Certain collection methods like xFirstOf_ weren't availble to arbitrary values. Closes #40.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* forall now counts the number of times each property is run, closing #41.








Kea 0.54.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-14

Further performance improvements.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Rewrote xIsIn and xNotIn in C++, yielding a x60 speedup when searching for 0 in 1:100000.

* Rewrote xSwap in C++, yielding an x30 speedup when replacing every value in a length 100,000 vector.

* Rewrote xTabulate in C++, making it much faster; x6.8 for a length 1000 collection of duplicates,
and x68 for a collection of unique elements.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added a note about the performance of xTabulate.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Added a failure hook to travis yaml.








Kea 0.53.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-14

Added xCharsOf, replaced xMeanOf and xMeanBy.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xCharsOf, a kea wrapper for nchar.

* Rewrote xImplode in C++, yielding a modest 50% speedup when collapsing 260,000
letters with a comma.

* Replaced xMeanOf with xMeanBy, which also takes a function argument. This is
for consistency with xSumBy and xProdBy.

* Rewrote xFromLines, xFromChars, xFromWords in C++, yielding similar performance gains to xImplode.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Greatly improved the documentation for x_.

* Removed a lie in xProdBy and xSumBy; both functions now acknowledge they accept length-zero
inputs.

* Attributed people who answered stackoverflow questions relevant to kea.








Kea 0.52.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-13

Improved performance of xZipKeys and xZip.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added error reporting to xZipKeys; error handling should be indistinguisable
from in its pre-C++ implementation.

* Rewrote xZip in C++, yielding a x7 times speedup for a 1000 x 1000 list.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed a serious bug in forall-next in which only length one and length
zero test cases were produced. Only minor breaks occurred in tests,

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Implemented an error checking function in C++, which will likely be
followed by many more.








Kea 0.51.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-10

Improved performance of xUnzipIndices and xUnzipKeys.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Rewrote xUnzipIndices in C++, yielding a x7 times speedup for 100,000 elements.

* Rewrote xUnzipKeys in C++, yielding a x10 times speedup for 100,000 elements.

BUG-FIXES:

* xRank now preserves its input names.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Added tests to functions that should preserve input names, closing #35.








Kea 0.50.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-8

Improved performance of xRiffle and xZipKeys.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Rewrote xRiffle in C++, making it x1000 times more efficient for
a ten-thousand element collection.

* Rewrote xZipKeys in C++, modestly improving its performance.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed a dumb bug in which factors and data frames didn't have access to
supposedly universal methods like xIdentity.








Kea 0.49.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-9-3

Added xAmend and negative prefix functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xAmend, which replaces parts of a string according to a regular expression.

* Added xNotInfixOf, xNotPrefixOf, and xNotSuffixOf, negative counterparts of the
functions added in v0.41.0.

* Re-implemented xChunk in C++, for speed.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed hundreds of lines of unneeded code from make_method, which significantly
improves the maintainability of the code base.








Kea 0.48.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-8-31

Added an experimental implementation of self-references.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added ability to self-reference the LHS in a method call. For example,
x_(letters) $ xJoin_(c(self, self)) concatenates the lower-case letters three times.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Modified method code to allow for self reference.

* Added tests for methods.

* Added a stripped down version of Hadley Wickham's substitute_q for metaprogramming.








Kea 0.47.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-8-25

First use of C++ code in kea.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Rewrote xTake and xDrop using Rcpp. This may cause unforseen issues, but also doubles the speed of the
function for n ~ 100,000.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed an issue in which functions with num, str, str1, str2, or rexp parametres
would parse inputs longer than one element, leading to more obscure failures downstream. Closes #22.

* Fixed an issue in which an arcane C stack usage error was given instead of a valid
error message for some collection function, closing #17.

* Fixed an incorrect error that was thrown by functions that can parse length-zero or length-one values
that claimed it could only parse length-one valuse.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added details section to xExecute.

* Clarified and rewrote corner-cases for xIsIn, xNotIn

* Added example for xFromLines, xIsPrefixOf.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Started using C++ to improve speed.








Kea 0.46.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-8-25

Added xAsList.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xAsList, an analogue of the base functions list/as.list.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed direct use of the function '%in%' due to its strange corner cases, closing #5.







Kea 0.45.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-8-25

Improved examples and function family labeling, fixed an error message bug.

BUG-FIXES:

* The correct error message is now produced when a function is given an collection of
improper length elements (closes #17).

DOCUMENTATION:

* Corrected example for xProdBy (now actually uses xProdBy).

* Labeled xFlatten as buggy, as issue (#13 is still unclosed.

* Removed outdated text about methods from x_ documentation.

* Added more thorough examples for x_.

* Added variadic form examples for xAllOf, xAnyOf, xIdentity.

* Added new examples for xIs, xIsMatch, xIsPrefixOf, xIsSuffixOf, xNotNull.

* Made xLenOf, xMaxBy, xMinBy, xMeanOf, xPoll, xOrderOf, xRank, xProdBy, xSumBy, math functions.

* Made example for xRead, xToWords, xUnspread more idiomatic.

* Improved function family labeling of other functions.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* throw_kea_error now checks that its input message has the correct length.







Kea 0.44.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-8-23

Added xSwap.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xSwap, a function that substitutes values in a list with another.










Kea 0.43.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-7-11

Added xRiffle, fixes a minor bug.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xRiffle, a function for interspersing values between elements of a collection.

* Lambda function construction is now marginally faster.

BUG-FIXES:

* The failing call is given when an incorrect method name is given (closes #15)

* Temporarily reverted behaviour of xFlatten; xFlatten now flattens lists
correctly, but may perform type coercion on its input. This is a known issue (#13),
and will be resolved in a future release.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added stability section to documentation of more unstable functions.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Improved the definition of ddquote, which should improve symbol
capturing in error messages.

* Added input validation to heavily-used utility functions pluralise

* Added tests for commonly used utility functions.

* Removed inject_expr, an unused function.










Kea 0.42.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-7-8

Minor bug-fixes.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed Kiwi to Kea, due to its double meaning.

BUG-FIXES:

* Higher-order functions no longer return an error message if the supplied function
fails, closing #11.

* Re-implemented xIsSubset, xNotSubset to avoid using '%in%', which likely fixes some corner cases
like NA %in% list(NA) == False.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed old implementations of partial application, replacing it with a much
shorter implementation that will be easier to add to lambda functions. This currently
has worse error checking than the old implementation; arguments aren't checked until
every argument is collected for a function.

* Added a new test for xUniqueOf.










Kea 0.41.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-7-2

Added subsequence predicates.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xIsPrefixOf, xIsSuffixOf, and xIsInfixOf, which test for subsequence matches
in a list.

* xIsSubset and xNotSubset now used identical to check each element, which does not have
odd corner cases like the previous method used.

* Made xIsVariadic more efficient.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed small, previously undetected errors in the precondition part of unit tests.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed the old forall testing tool.










Kea 0.40.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-7-1

The initial public release!












Kea 0.39.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-28

Improved recursive kea functions and fixed serious bugs.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* xDeepMap no longer uses recursion, and as such does not suffer from
stack overflows any more.

* xFlatten uses less recursion than previously, and is more unlikely to
cause a stack overflow.

* xSliceString now preserves it's input names.

BUG-FIXES:

* x_ now works on values of any type again: after its recent refactoring
it failed for strange values like symbols.

* fixed misnamed variable that would cause failures if a warning
was thrown while writing to a file.

* xFlatten no longer coerces inputs to a set type upon flattening;
xFlatten(1, list('a', 1, 2)) is now c('a', 1, 2), not c('a', 1, 2).
Closes #2.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed most old forall tests, with the exception of xLambda tests.

* Added several recursive test-case generators.

* Blacklisted use of 'unlist' due to type coercion: use of '%in%' will likely follow.

* Added recursive test-case generators.

* Added tool for testing the generic type of a collection, for testing.

* Added xCycle, xDelay, xFold, xForall, xFromChars, xFromLines, xFromWords,
xInterOf, xIsMatch, xKeysOf, xLimitOf, xNotMatch, xScan, and xUnspread.













Kea 0.38.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-25

Added two new arithmetic functions, updated documentation.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xSumBy, xProdBy, which compute the sum or product of a list
by a measure function.

* xRead now reads files in UTF-8 encoding.

* Removed special treatment of parametres of the form val_ in lambda functions;
this added too much complication and helped create functions with odd type signatures.
x_(val) is almost as short.

BUG-FIXES:

* xSpread now tests if its input function is unary.

* xSliceString now has it's numbers as its first parametre, in line with xAt and xSlice.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added corner-case documentation to several functions.

* Fixed build warnings surrounding documentation.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* To be kinder to CRAN, tests now run for .3 seconds instead of 2 seconds.













Kea 0.37.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-25

Added xIndicesTo, improved error messages, and spell-checked docs.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Add xIndicesTo, which is a Kea analogue for seq_len.

* Functions that require numbers in a range now show the failing number if this
property isn't met.

* Functions that require positive indices now show the failing number if this
property isn't met.

* Functions that require collections of equal length now show the lengths if this
property isn't met.

* Functions that require collections of a set length now show the length if this
property isn't met.


DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed typos in the documentation and examples.

* Improved xChoose, xStopWatch example.

* Added examples for xAtKey, xDrop, xIndicesTo.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed non-standard top levels scripts from package.







Kea 0.36.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-22

Adds an arity-checking macro for HOF's that require functions with a certain arity.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Higher-order-functions now check that their input functions can
accept the required number of arguments.

BUG-FIXES:

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed unneeded uses of xFix( ) from examples, replacing it with
actual partial application.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Added Must_Have_Arity macro.

* Added params_of, and pluralise functions.







Kea 0.35.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-21

Removed xAtCol, fixed several bugs.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed xIsMember to xIsIn and xNotMemer to xNotIn, for brevity.

* Removed xAtCol, in line with removing xPluck; partial application makes
writing xMap(xAt(num)) possible instead.

* Flatten now removes the names of it's input collection to prevent multiple
keys being added to the same flat list.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed a terrible, long-standing corner-case in xReduce; xReduce of the
empty list now fails rather than return that collection.

* xMaxBy, xMinBy, now fail cleanly when their input function creates Na or NaN values.

* Removed a call to print() accidentally left in xDrop after debugging.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next tests for xAddKeys, xApply, xDeepMap, xDuplicatesOf,
xExplode, xFix, xFlatten, xIsIn, xIsNa, xIsNull, xIsSubset, xIterate, xLastOf,
xMinBy, xMaxBy, xNegate, xNotIn, xNotNull, xNotSubset, xPowerSetOf, xReduce,
xRepeat, xToChars, xToLines, xToWords.








Kea 0.34.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-16

Removed positional setters.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed positional setters from Kea; they were a poor attemmpt at making
mutation on par with selecting in kea, but were not generalisable or very
useful.








Kea 0.33.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-16

Fixed several bugs introduced when overhauling methods.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improved method-name suggestion; certain easy-predictable spelling
mistakes are now handled manually.

BUG-FIXES:

* Some variadic methods, such as xGroupBy_, did not have an ellipsis
parametre; these methods would not run.

* Some kea methods are no longer called with named arguments, so no
unneeded names are added to outputs.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* added forall-next tests for xNotMatch, xNotTrue, xProdSetOf, xSliceString.








Kea 0.32.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-11

A major release; overhauled methods, added xMeanOf.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Methods are now available in more forms; when a method is called on a value that
could be used as an input to multiple parametres the LHS of the method call can be
set as any of the parametres. This is less arbitrary than the previous system in which
one parametre was chosen (by hand) to be fixed as the left-hand side of a method call.

* Methods can no longer be automatically partially applied, though this ability
may be re-instated in a future release. This isn't a great loss, as partial application
of methods was confusing, verbose and an unintential side-effect of having partially-applicable
functions.

* Added xMeanOf, which wraps R's mean function.

* Renamed xRankOf to xRank, as function names should be verbs where
possible and the function does actually rank numbers.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed the use of xFix from several examples in which it was not needed.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Replaced the hand-written, likely buggy addition of methods by hand with
automatically generated methods.

* Removed a set of tests that tried to verify the correctness of method implementation,
which is no longer relevant.

* Removed a test for partial application of methods, as that is no longer permitted.

* Improved string test coverage; all printable ascii characters are tested.








Kea 0.31.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-7

Added xValues of, removed xPartition, added tests.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xValuesOf, the complement of xKeyOf and xIndicesOf. xValuesOf removes
the keys from a collection.

* Removed xPartition; I've never seen it used in the wild, and it can be easily
re-introduced as xPartition = xJuxtapose_(xSelect, xReject)

BUG FIXES:

* xStopWatch no longer fails for named number inputs.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next for the tests must-all-be-indices, must-be-collection,
must-be-equal-length-to, must-be-flag, must-be-of-length macros.

* Added forall-next test for xShuffle, xSlice, xSortBy,	xSpread, xStopwatch,
xValuesOf.











Kea 0.30.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-5

Improved xAs* family of functions, labelling of higher-order-function errors, removed xMapply.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added clear labelling of errors and warnings thrown by
functions given to higher-order functions.

* Removed xMapply; despite being useful it was a compound of xMap and
xUnspread, and similar functions like xSelect don't have analogous compositions.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed an undeclared reference in 'check_regexp' try-catch.

* xAsRaw (and it's internal backend as_typed_vector ) now throws an error for NA
values, as NA's cannot be converted to raw.

* as_typed_vector (the backend to the xAs* functions) now correctly type-converts
vectors of only NA values to a target type.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed usage sections from methods, as they raised warnings.

* Added example for xPrepend.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Improved the efficiency of kea tests, allowing for many more test-cases
to be used in a given timespan.

* Added rigourous tests for atomic-vector handling by as_typed_vector.

* Removed benchmarks; kea will use branches for benchmarks in the future.











Kea 0.29.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-30

A major breaking update. Overhauls named-collection handling.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* xAtCol, xCycle, xDrop,
xDropWhile, xFlatMap, xInitOf, xMap, xMapply, xOrderOf,
xPartition, xRank, xReject, xRestOf, xReverse, xSelect,
xShuffle, xSlice, xSortBy, xTake, xTakeWhile, xUnzipIndices,
xWhere now preserve collection names, including for empty
collections.

* The element types within a list are now summarised by summate.

BUG FIXES:

* xIsNa (and internal NA checking tools) now return true for named NA values.

* checking if a value is a collection now false for factors.

* The parametre 'num' now checks and fails if its argument is Na.

* Summation of character-vectors now includes the number of NA values in
the input.

* Summation of incorrect arguments now corrently handles NA values in vectors.

* Infinite values are now included as whole numbers during argument summation.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Corrected type signature of xExplode.

* Added example for xPrepend.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next tests for xTake, xDrop, xFlatMap,
xGroupBy, xInitOf, xNotFalse, xRestOf, xReverse, xTabulate.

* is_na and elem_is_na is now true for named NA elements.

* Generators are now created using function composition,
for ease of writing. These will be optimised in the next
release.

* Updated tests to check for named length-zero corner-cases.

* Added a macro must_not_contain_nan.

* Removed unit_to_value.

* Named inputs are now used as test cases.

* as_typed_vector now handles named inputs correctly.

* Added worksWhen element to grammar, which tests if a program
executes without exception.

* Added internal functions to manipulate names.

* Omitted unneeded ::: calls in load_test_dependencies.

* Removed flotsam-calls test.








Kea 0.28.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-26

Improved handling of string corner-cases.

BUG FIXES:

* Incorrect arguments to 'rexp' parametre now throws a useful
error when it is not a collection.

* 'num' now checks and fails if its argument is NaN.

* Regular expressions are now validated before use, and throw
clear errors if invalid.

* Regular expressions throw a clear error if NA is provided.

* Arguments matching 'str', 'str1', and 'str2' may no longer be NA.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added macros must-be-non-na, must-be-non-nan, must-not-contain-na.

* Added function to validate regular expressions.








Kea 0.27.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-26

Improvements to numeric corner-cases, BUG FIXES, and speedups.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* xCompose no longer collects its arguments: this means that
xCompose_(identity) is now identical to identity.

* xOrderOf now returns indices that sort in increaing order, for
consistency with xSortBy.

* xOrderOf now throws an error for NA and NaN input, as they
are unorderable.

* xRank now throws an error for NA and NaN input, as they
are unorderable.

* xOrderOf is now faster.

BUG FIXES:

* fns parametre arguments now correctly reassigned after function lookup.

* Type conversion of any na to any other na is now allowed.

* xCycle now fails when trying to cycle infinitely far.

* xRepeat now throws a clear error when trying to repeat infinitely.

* Removed second, redundant type conversion from xAs* family of functions,
which should increase performance.

* xChoose no longer fails for length-zero numbers.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added must-be-finite, must-be-orderable macros.

* Added a forall-next test to xAt, xChoose, xCompose, xJuxtapose,
xNotNa, xIsNull, xOrderOf, xRank, xStopWatch, xThread.

* Renamed 'when' to 'holdsWhen'.

* Devectorised is_na.








Kea 0.26.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-24

Added two new functions, fixed a bug in input validation.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xIndicesOf, which that returns the indices of a collection.

* Added xKeysOf, which returns the names of a collection.

* Removed '%of%', one of two infix composition operators. Calls to
%then% are easier to read.

BUG FIXES:

* the parametre 'fns' ands 'colls' now correctly validates its input;
previously it did not check if its argument was a collection of functions
or function names.

* A temporary variable created by the must-be-collection-of-fn-matchable
macro is now hidden.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next tests for xIndicesOf.










Kea 0.25.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-20

Removed several functions, made partially applied function throw better error messages.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Partially-applied functions give a clearer call when they throw an error, showing
 the name of the kea function that threw the error.

* xAtKey now throws an error if the input collection does not contain the required
key, rather than returning NULL.

* Removed xPluck, as it was simply a vectorised form of xAtKey, with the same task
better achieved by xMap(xAtKey()).

* Removed xSplitAt and xSplitWith, as their corner cases are currently unclear
 and they are largely untested. Decatenation functions will be reintroduced
 at a later date, though probably in a different form.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a bug in xRead; multiple lines are now correctly collapsed with the
newline character.

* Functions with the parametre 'fns' now checks that 'fns' is a collection.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added a new macro for ensuring a collection's names contains a key.

* Added a forall-next test for xParamsOf.












Kea 0.24.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-18

Major internal update, changes corner-cases of most functions, removed two functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed xInter to xInterOf, for consistancy with xUnionOf.

* Removed xRecycle, as it is now possible to recycle with xRepeat, xMap and xTake easily.

* Removed xReorder, as xSlice and xMap can reorder easily.

* Functions that take a number or string now treat numeric(0) or string(0) in a similar
manner to how collection functions return the empty collection. Conceptually, these atomic
inputs are treated like values in a Maybe type.

This is more logical than the previous behaviour of converting empty numbers or strings
to length-one values, but there are likely bad corner cases introduced in this release that
will be ironed out in the future.

* xAnyOf, ..., xNoneOf, xSelect, xReject, xPartition, xDropWhile,
xTakeWhile, xPoll, xSplitWith now throws an error if a non-boolean result is given by
an input predicate.

BUG FIXES:

* xChop and xChunk now respond useful errors for NaN values.

* Functions that require collections no longer accept factors.

* xJuxtapose no longer has the insane corner-case of returning the empty list
when supplied no functions; it now returns a function as it originally should have.

* xImplode no longer excludes length-zero or empty strings
from its input collection.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Improved documentation of corner-cases.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Refactored macros into their own files; this should aid testing significantly.

* num, str...str2, rexp have their type-checking code automatically injected into
kea functions now.

* Added a forall-next test for xImplode












Kea 0.23.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-14

Improves arrow function, with speed improvements, BUG FIXES, new features.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Arrow functions now support underscore parametres; any parametre with an underscore
suffix is automatically made into a kea object, and the underscores are removed from the parametre.

* xLambda is no longer directly exported, as kea is not a metaprogramming library
and there are no tests validating it works when directly called.

* Improved the performance of arrow functions, particularily for unary functions with no
underscores.

BUG FIXES:

* Arrow functions now correctly displays where its errors were raised from.

* Fixed a typo in arrow function error message.

* Errors are now thrown for duplicated parametres before the function is invoked.

* Removed unneeded call to `sys.call` in xCompose, which should speed up generated
functions significantly.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added an example to xChunk.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added join_exprs, which joins two expressions into a single expression.












Kea 0.22.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-12

Improved performance of some functions significantly.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* To simplify code injection, factors now have the corresponding
parametre 'fact' and matrices/data-frames the parametre 'tab'.

* Removed filtering of no-character strings from xToWords, xToLines, xToChars,
to keep in line with xImplode's recent change. Leading whitespaces ARE
still removed, though this may be modified in the future.

* Speedup of xArityOf, xAsVar, xAsVal, xIsVal, xVal, xShuffle, xUnspread,
and the wildcard operators x. $ and x. @.

* Minor speedup of functions that call 'unit_to_value' or 'as_typed_vector'.

* Method lookup is now slightly quicker.

BUG FIXES:

* xIsVariadic of nullary functions is now logical(0), to be consistant
with other logical functions.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed a type of xToWords.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Simplified automatic precondition writing.

* The parametres nums, strs, ints, and bools now automatically inject
their boilerplate into their respective functions.

* Removed explicit use of strsplit, replacing it with str_split.

* Removed use of toString, for efficiencies sake now using paste.

* Added a forall-next test, testing if partial application works when
parametres are matched out-of-order.

* Added a forall-next test for xIsVariadic, xJoin.












Kea 0.21.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-11

An internal update, that adds automatic addition of argument-writing code.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Variadic functions are now more efficient.

BUG FIXES:

* x_ now adds a newline before printing.

* Fixed a name collision in partially applied functions that affected
functions with a 'fn' parametre.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* The Fix macro now injects argument-checking macros into a function
based on the parametre name, making it an ad-hoc type system.

* Removed most explicit calls to macro's from function definitions;
they are now automatically injected.

* Removed explicit function matching from functions with fn, pred or
fns parametres.

* Added forall-next test for partially-applied methods, xDropWhile,
xTakeWhile, xUnionOf, xWhere.

* Removed test for macros, since they are no longer written by hand.













Kea 0.20.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-10

Removed specialised reading/writing functions, adds xRead and xWrite.

Date: 2014-6-11

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xRead, which reads a file as a single string.

* Added xWrite, which writes a single string to a file.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Updated xAddKey examples to exploit partial application.













Kea 0.19.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-10

A minor update. Adds xLastAs, fixes a bug in xFirstAs...xFourthAs.

Date: 2014-6-10

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xLastAs, which sets the last value of a collection.

BUG FIXES:

* xFirstAs ... xFourthAs could not be correctly partially-applied. This is fixed, and
a future version of Kea will guard against these errors.

DOCUMENTATION:

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Updated the xVal test to work correctly with Rscript testing commands;
tests now run correctly from the command line.

* Added Rscript to run a single unit test.

* Added a forall-next test for xGroupBy, xLastAs.












Kea 0.18.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-9

Adds further support for automatic partial application, adds mutator
functions & removed some vectorised functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added automatic partial application to the variadic forms of functions.

* Added xAppend, xPrepend for inserting elements into a collection.

* Added xFirstAs, xSecondAs, xThirdAs, and xFourthAs. These functions set their
respective position in a collection to a value.

* xCycle no longer operates on collections of collections, instead on flat collections.
Partial application reduces the need for collection-of-collection functions, and simple
type signatures are more composable than complex ones.

* Removed xElemIs, xElemNot; partial application means that 'xMap(xIs(val))' works
perfectly well, eliminating the benefit of these functions.

* xExplode no longer removes length-zero elements produced on exploding; although
strsplit can introduce such elements spuriously, removing them can cause difficulties.
This may be addressed by not ussing strsplit internally in a future version.

* xFromChars, xFromWords, xFromLines no longer call xImplode internally, so error-messages
should be identified as coming from them, not xImplode.

DOCUMENTATION:

* xByRowKeys documentation now correctly builds.

* Removed embarassing use of the word 'automatical' from README.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Testing tools can now be run from the command line, with colourised output. Some
tests currently break when run in this mode.

* MakeVariadic now inserts the 'Fix' macro into its generated functions.

* Wrote forall-next tests for xCycle, xAppend, xPrepend, xFirstAs, xSecondAs,
xThirdAs, xFourthAs, xUniqueOf.












Kea 0.17.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-7

Adds automatic partial application to every function in Kea. No tests are
currently breaking, but this feature likely interferes with error reporting.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Kea functions are now partially-appliable; not all arguments need to be
provided at once. This is an important milestone. Errors are no longer thrown
for missing inputs for this reason.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a bug that crashed error handing due to improper conversion of a
function to a string during error message creation.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added fix, a variant of xFix required for efficient partial application of
internal functions.

* Added Fix, a macro added to functions that need to be partially applied.

* Fixed an incorrect definition of test_negative; now correctly applies case
to property.

* Removed test for the missing macro, since this is no longer needed.

* Added unit tests for xFirstOf, xFourthOf, xIsNan, xIsTrue, xList, xLocate,
xNotNan, xOneOf, xPoll, xReject, xSecondOf, xThirdOf, xUnit, xUnspread,
xUnzipIndices, and xUnzipKeys.

* Added inject_expr, which inserts a line into the head of an expression body.
Currenty untested.












Kea 0.16.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-7

A very minor update. Renamed library from it's working name (Arrow) to
a final name (Kea), refactored internals.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed non-ascii characters from documentation (lambda, epsilon).

* Renamed method-only function's title from $ xMethod to xMethod.

* Rewrote readme.

Package Internals

* Refactored forall-next to remove code duplication.

* forall-next now works correctly for negative tests.

* added additional tests for forall-next itself.

* added negative test to xAt.

* added tests to xChunk, xDo, xMap, xSelect.












Kea 0.15.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-5

This release adds some rigourous tests to kea, and fixes several bugs.

BUG FIXES:

* xChop called with Inf now returns a list of length-one lists, instead of
converting its input to a list.

* xNoneOf now detects whether not-any result was true, instead of not-any.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed a broken roxygen tag in xElemsByCols.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next tests for xAllOf, xAnyOf, xArityOf, xCapture, xChop,
xFalsity, xFirstOf, xIdentity, xIrrelevance, xIsEmpty, xIsFalse, xIsTrue,
xNoneOf, xNotEmpty, xPoll, xReject, xSecondOf, xTabulate, xThirdOf,
xTruth, xVersion, xZip and xZipKeys.












Kea 0.14.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-5

This version removes xVectorise and xGraft, and cleans up the method code.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xUnit_, a variadic form of xUnit.

* The method $ xExecute now passes its left-hand side self argument to its
anonymous function (the lambda was previous zero-argument).

* Removed xVectorise/xVectorize; future versions of Kea will include
automatic partial application (or at the very least pre-currying), so
vectorise will become redundant.

* Removed xGraft, which allowed custom methods to be added to the kea
call chain. It was untested, unusued, and barely more useful than xTap.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added missing parametre documentation for x__ (its ... argument).

BUG FIXES:

* xExecute & xTap now performs function lookup on its input function/string argument.
For example, xTap('mean') will now call xTap with the mean function.

* Fixed potential error in xByRows, xByCols for empty matrices/data.frames. Now returns
the empty list for that case.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Moved all functions only available as methods into their own files,
instead of having direct definitions in x_.R. This aids code uniformity & testing.

* forall-next can now take multiple descriptions, and has improved error reporting for
positive failures.

* changed describe from an overriding field to a joining field in the forall-next tools.

* factored prototype inheritance into a function.

* Removed errant in-prototype definitions of xThread; now uses the method-adding
function.

* added forall-next tests for x_

* renamed make_formals to as_formals, removed the 'as_parametres' alias for as_formals

* removed join-env, is_fn_matchable; neither was ever called by kea.












Kea 0.13.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-2

A mostly internal update, removes two quantifier functions and adds x__.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added x__, the variadic form of x_.

* Removed xExists and xForall; the addition of xAnyOf and xAnyOf is equivalent
for most cases, and for the remaining cases (polyadic functions) using xProdSetOf
and a quantifier is identical, and favours composition.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added examples to xAddKeys, xByLevels, xChoose, xElemNot, xIsMember, xNotTrue,

BUG FIXES:

* xOneOf now throws an error for an empty collection, as it is impossible to
return any elements in this case.

* Factors passed to x_ now get assigned the correct set of methods; previously
they were given collection methods, as factors are technically collections.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Seperated the next forall tool into modules, fixed several bugs. The tool is now
effective for simple test cases, but more work is required for negative tests.

* Added new-style tests to xIs, xNot, xOneOf.

* Simplified the '+.xforall' method with higher-order functions.











Kea 0.12.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-28

A major but mostly internal update; upgraded testing tools and removed dangerous
function calls.

A major but mostly internal update; upgraded testing tools and removed dangerous
function calls.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added 'all empty' and 'any empty' property tests to value summation for lists,
and dimension reporting for data frames.

* Added property tests for inner kea objects in summated lists.

* Removed special handling of NA's from xElemIs and xElemNot, but this may be
re-implemented in the future.

* Removed the x_ method from Kea, since x_Identity does the same thing
in a more obvious way.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed missing spaces in error messages produced by incorrectly typed vectors.

* Simplified behaviour of xIsNan, xNotNa, xNotNan, xIsNan, potentially
correcting issues for non length-one vectors.

* Removed use of sample, potetentially fixing bugs with numeric vectors.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added example for xElemIs, xLocate, xReadChars, xReadLines, xReadwords,
xRestOf, xParamsOf.

* Removed redundant @method tags from documentation.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added a rigourous test for example length, file existence, function calls
to dangerous functions, and for missing 'missing' functions, and removed an
older similar test suite.

* Implemented a new testing tool for Kea, which should give more complete
test coverage and both positive and negative controls. The syntax is also
improved. xSelect currently uses this tool exclusively, and its use will be
expanded in future versions.

* Added a simple test for the new forall tool, though more are needed.

* Removed direct use of is.na; the function can fail for null values, and
testing functions should never fail. Further testing functions will be wrapped
or removed at a later date.

* Removed direct use of sample, as the function has a bizzare corner case
for length-one number vectors.

* Added elem_is_na and elem_is_nan, to replace the use of is.na and
is.nan for vectors.

* Removed direct use of is.atomic and is.list, replacing them with functions that
fix their null corner case.

* Added a minor fix to ith_suffix corner case which now supports infinite
values, in the unlikely case they will arise.

* throw_kea_warning now actually throws a warning, not an error. The function
was not used, so no bug fixes are required.











Kea 0.11.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-19

Removes several data frame and matrix methods, and adds many examples.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed xColUnit, xRowUnit, xFullUnit. Although theoretically useful
they were largely untested and unused. May be added in future if genuinely needed.

* Removed xTranspose. Kea as a policy does not support matrices and data frames,
only their conversion to other types. There are effective ways to transpose lists
in Kea already.

BUG FIXES:

* Added xCapture alias xK to the methods avaiable to all values. More rigourous
tests will be added in future to avoid missing methods.

* xByColkeys & xByRowkeys for matrices now return character vectors.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed type signature of xPluck, xRepeat.

* Added example to (or improved example for):
xAddKeys, xAllOf, xAsCharacter, xAsComplex,
xAsDouble, xAsInteger, xAsLogical, xCapture, xChunk, xDeepMap,
xDelay, xElemsByCols, xElemsByRows, xExecute, xFix, xFormalsOf,
xFromChars, xIsFalse, xIsMatch, xLift, xLocate, xMinBy, xNoneOf,
xNotEmpty, xNotFalse, xNotMembers, xNotNan, xNotNull, xPartition,
xShuffle, xSlice, xThread, xToChars, xUniqueOf,

* Added details to xByRows.

* Html-escaped docs for xToChars, xToLines, xToWords.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added tests for xIsSubset, xNotSubset.

* Added tests for xNegate.

* Added .babelignore, to allow easier random access of useful kea files.

* Added rsample, which corrects a bad length-one corner case in sample. Will
remove direct use of sample from kea in future. Bugs caused by sample may
come to light in the next release.











Kea 0.10.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-16

Removes the xElemIs*, xElemNot* and xReject* family of functions,
replacing them with the more generix xElemIs and xElemNot.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xElemIs and xElemNot. These functions test each element of a
collection for equality to a value.

* Renamed xIsNot to xNot, for consistency with the other predicate names
in Kea.

* Removed xElemIsFalse, xElemIsNa, xElemIsTrue, xElemNotFalse, xElemNotNa,
xElemNotTrue, xElemIsNull, xElemIsNan, xElemNotNan, xElemNotNull,
xRejectNa, xRejectNan, xRejectNull, xRejectEmpty. The rational for this
is that kea emphasises compositionality, and each case these functions solve
can easily be done with other functions. This reduces the number of tests and
documentation to be maintained significantly.

BUG FIXES:

* xByColkeys and xByRowkeys now return character vectors.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added large example to xFix.

* Clarified/corrected return values of xWrite* family of functions.

* Corrected type signatures of xMinBy and xMayBy.

* Corrected return value of xByColkeys.

* Clarified xFromChars' description.

* Added minor details to xIsMatch.

* Added example to xByCols and xByRows.

* Added example to xNotNa.

* Added example to xNotNan.

* Removed non-parsing example from xUnzipIndices.

* Added example to xUnzipIndices.

* Extended xUnit's example.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Removed unevaluated check for kea objects in one case
of as_typed_vector's if condition.

* Added test to xUnionOf.











Kea 0.9.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-12

This release adds xIsNot, improves documentation.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* added xIsNot, a complement to xIs.

* Improved error messages provided when converting vector types;
if an kea object is supplied (accidentally) this is stated.

* Implemented basic object summarisation for data frames (upon error).

BUG FIXES:

* xAtCol now attempts to container type-convert its numeric input "num".

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added details and corner cases to xAtCol.

* Added details to xUnzipIndices.

* Added corner cases section to xAsComplex, xAsCharacter.

* Clarified a corner case in xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* added fromStream, part of the testing tool in development.

* throw_kea_error can now be called without a call argument.

* forall will now correctly report errors; previously the argument order was backwards.












Kea 0.8.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-11

This release drastically improves the appearance of error messages.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* improved the appearance of error messages; they now take up less space.

* for error-causing lists, two new properties are displayed in the error:
'is nested' and 'all nested'.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* renamed propeties of summate to use whitespace instead of underscores.

* as_typed_vector and as_atom are now more documented, and slightly more efficient.

* refactored back end to remove older error-message containing like exclaim and lament,
in favour of in-place definitions.

* removed maybe_atomic & newline

* used as_parameters in MakeVariadic, to avoid code duplication.











Kea 0.7.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-10

A mostly internal release, renamed Any, xNone, to xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed xAll, xAny, xNone, to xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf. This complies better
with Kea's naming conventions.

* Functions that require collections, functions, or collections of functions
will now inform the user if they were (accidentally) given an kea object.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added more accurate desciption to the xAs* family of container converters.

* Escaped most special characters in type signatures; html documentation will now
render correctly in most cases.

* Minor updates to the readme.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Deprecated and removed assert, moving over to the more flexible
functions throw_kea_error and throw_kea_warning.

* Added extensive tests for xUnzipIndices.

* Added test to ensure xJoin always returns a list.











Kea 0.6.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-7

Added xNotSubset, renamed xNot and removed xAsClosure.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xNotSubset, to complement the function xIsSubset.

* Renamed xNot to xNegate, to allow for a complement to be added to xIs.

* Removed xAsClosure; the function had very minimal likely use-cases,
and did not work for every primitive function.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Removed a lot of dead code (mostly error message code).

* Added tests to xElemIs_ functions.

* Made stringify_call more robust.

* Commented xList code extensively.












Kea 0.5.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

A feature-rich version; adds three new functions for testing equality
and match/mismatch against a regular expression.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xIs; a function for testing if values are identical.

* Added xIsMatch; tests if a string matches a regular expression.

* Added xNotMatch; tests if a string doesn't match a regular expression.

BUG FIXES:

* renamed xAddKeys... to xAddKeys_, to keep in step with other variadic
methods.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added example for xIs.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added tests for xIs, xIsMatch, xNotMatch.











Kea 0.4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

This version adds xNone and a logo, and fixes an important bug in error-reporting
functions (no irony whatsoever).

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xNone; the antonym of xAllOf. It completes the set of functions
xAllOf (does every element match a predicate?), xAnyOf (does any element match a predicate?)
and now xNone (does no value match a predicate?).

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed an issue in reporting of missing arguments (and possibly other exceptions). The
name of the argument for which an error is thrown is now displayed properly.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added a prototype logo for Kea!

* Added details section to xMap, explaining the basic concept of map.

* Added details section to xVersion, explaining the semantic versioning standard.

* Added example for xLastOf.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Fixed broken link tags in header of staticdocs head file.

* Added contact page (though jQuery) to staticdocs site.

* dQuote now lazily captures its argument.

* added tests for xNone.










Kea 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-3

A bug-fix release.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Very slightly improved xProdSetOf's efficiency by changing an inner Map
to lapply.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a bug in as_method, in which variadic methods were not being generated
due to the use of an outdated regular expression to test whether the input function
was variadic.

* Type-errors in functions that take collections (xExplode for example) now report
the user-facing function they were thrown from.

* Fixed corner-case for xOneOf; if given a length one vector it extracts the value
from its collection (if it is a list).

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added most missing type signatures to function docs.
* Added several missing titles to function docs.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* as_atom and as_typed_vector now use the parent call
(sys.call(-1)) in error reports.

* Added test to check that every function has a type signature and title.











Kea 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-2

A minor release, mostly housekeeping and repaying technical debt.

BUG FIXES:

* the xAsComplex, xAsInteger... family of functions now support conversion
of lists that contain NA values of any mode, at the cost of some performance.

* xLambda now checks that ':' is used as a parametre delimiter;
previously several infix functions could be used.

DOCUMENTATION:

* type signatures added to several more function's documentation.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* internal function `MakeVariadic` used to generate variadic forms of
functions, which should help avoid bugs in their definitions.

* eliminated most error-message functions, in favour of in-place
definitions and macros. This removed a lot of unneeded code.

* internal function `unit_to_value` now supports complex values.










Kea 0.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-4-30

The initial release of Kea. A highly experimental release, and ideally not
the version the public will see.












Kea 0.42.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-7-8

Minor bug-fixes.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed Kiwi to Kea, due to its double meaning.

BUG-FIXES:

* Higher-order functions no longer return an error message if the supplied function
fails, closing #11.

* Re-implemented xIsSubset, xNotSubset to avoid using '%in%', which likely fixes some corner cases
like NA %in% list(NA) == False.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed old implementations of partial application, replacing it with a much
shorter implementation that will be easier to add to lambda functions. This currently
has worse error checking than the old implementation; arguments aren't checked until
every argument is collected for a function.

* Added a new test for xUniqueOf.










Kea 0.41.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-7-2

Added subsequence predicates.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xIsPrefixOf, xIsSuffixOf, and xIsInfixOf, which test for subsequence matches
in a list.

* xIsSubset and xNotSubset now used identical to check each element, which does not have
odd corner cases like the previous method used.

* Made xIsVariadic more efficient.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed small, previously undetected errors in the precondition part of unit tests.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed the old forall testing tool.










Kea 0.40.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-7-1

The initial public release!












Kea 0.39.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-28

Improved recursive kea functions and fixed serious bugs.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* xDeepMap no longer uses recursion, and as such does not suffer from
stack overflows any more.

* xFlatten uses less recursion than previously, and is more unlikely to
cause a stack overflow.

* xSliceString now preserves it's input names.

BUG-FIXES:

* x_ now works on values of any type again: after its recent refactoring
it failed for strange values like symbols.

* fixed misnamed variable that would cause failures if a warning
was thrown while writing to a file.

* xFlatten no longer coerces inputs to a set type upon flattening;
xFlatten(1, list('a', 1, 2)) is now c('a', 1, 2), not c('a', 1, 2).
Closes #2.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed most old forall tests, with the exception of xLambda tests.

* Added several recursive test-case generators.

* Blacklisted use of 'unlist' due to type coercion: use of '%in%' will likely follow.

* Added recursive test-case generators.

* Added tool for testing the generic type of a collection, for testing.

* Added xCycle, xDelay, xFold, xForall, xFromChars, xFromLines, xFromWords,
xInterOf, xIsMatch, xKeysOf, xLimitOf, xNotMatch, xScan, and xUnspread.













Kea 0.38.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-25

Added two new arithmetic functions, updated documentation.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xSumBy, xProdBy, which compute the sum or product of a list
by a measure function.

* xRead now reads files in UTF-8 encoding.

* Removed special treatment of parametres of the form val_ in lambda functions;
this added too much complication and helped create functions with odd type signatures.
x_(val) is almost as short.

BUG-FIXES:

* xSpread now tests if its input function is unary.

* xSliceString now has it's numbers as its first parametre, in line with xAt and xSlice.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added corner-case documentation to several functions.

* Fixed build warnings surrounding documentation.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* To be kinder to CRAN, tests now run for .3 seconds instead of 2 seconds.













Kea 0.37.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-25

Added xIndicesTo, improved error messages, and spell-checked docs.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Add xIndicesTo, which is a Kea analogue for seq_len.

* Functions that require numbers in a range now show the failing number if this
property isn't met.

* Functions that require positive indices now show the failing number if this
property isn't met.

* Functions that require collections of equal length now show the lengths if this
property isn't met.

* Functions that require collections of a set length now show the length if this
property isn't met.


DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed typos in the documentation and examples.

* Improved xChoose, xStopWatch example.

* Added examples for xAtKey, xDrop, xIndicesTo.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Removed non-standard top levels scripts from package.







Kea 0.36.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-22

Adds an arity-checking macro for HOF's that require functions with a certain arity.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Higher-order-functions now check that their input functions can
accept the required number of arguments.

BUG-FIXES:

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed unneeded uses of xFix( ) from examples, replacing it with
actual partial application.

PACKAGE-INTERNALS:

* Added Must_Have_Arity macro.

* Added params_of, and pluralise functions.







Kea 0.35.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-21

Removed xAtCol, fixed several bugs.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed xIsMember to xIsIn and xNotMemer to xNotIn, for brevity.

* Removed xAtCol, in line with removing xPluck; partial application makes
writing xMap(xAt(num)) possible instead.

* Flatten now removes the names of it's input collection to prevent multiple
keys being added to the same flat list.

BUG-FIXES:

* Fixed a terrible, long-standing corner-case in xReduce; xReduce of the
empty list now fails rather than return that collection.

* xMaxBy, xMinBy, now fail cleanly when their input function creates Na or NaN values.

* Removed a call to print() accidentally left in xDrop after debugging.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next tests for xAddKeys, xApply, xDeepMap, xDuplicatesOf,
xExplode, xFix, xFlatten, xIsIn, xIsNa, xIsNull, xIsSubset, xIterate, xLastOf,
xMinBy, xMaxBy, xNegate, xNotIn, xNotNull, xNotSubset, xPowerSetOf, xReduce,
xRepeat, xToChars, xToLines, xToWords.








Kea 0.34.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-16

Removed positional setters.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed positional setters from Kea; they were a poor attemmpt at making
mutation on par with selecting in kea, but were not generalisable or very
useful.








Kea 0.33.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-16

Fixed several bugs introduced when overhauling methods.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Improved method-name suggestion; certain easy-predictable spelling
mistakes are now handled manually.

BUG-FIXES:

* Some variadic methods, such as xGroupBy_, did not have an ellipsis
parametre; these methods would not run.

* Some kea methods are no longer called with named arguments, so no
unneeded names are added to outputs.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* added forall-next tests for xNotMatch, xNotTrue, xProdSetOf, xSliceString.








Kea 0.32.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-11

A major release; overhauled methods, added xMeanOf.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Methods are now available in more forms; when a method is called on a value that
could be used as an input to multiple parametres the LHS of the method call can be
set as any of the parametres. This is less arbitrary than the previous system in which
one parametre was chosen (by hand) to be fixed as the left-hand side of a method call.

* Methods can no longer be automatically partially applied, though this ability
may be re-instated in a future release. This isn't a great loss, as partial application
of methods was confusing, verbose and an unintential side-effect of having partially-applicable
functions.

* Added xMeanOf, which wraps R's mean function.

* Renamed xRankOf to xRank, as function names should be verbs where
possible and the function does actually rank numbers.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed the use of xFix from several examples in which it was not needed.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Replaced the hand-written, likely buggy addition of methods by hand with
automatically generated methods.

* Removed a set of tests that tried to verify the correctness of method implementation,
which is no longer relevant.

* Removed a test for partial application of methods, as that is no longer permitted.

* Improved string test coverage; all printable ascii characters are tested.








Kea 0.31.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-7

Added xValues of, removed xPartition, added tests.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xValuesOf, the complement of xKeyOf and xIndicesOf. xValuesOf removes
the keys from a collection.

* Removed xPartition; I've never seen it used in the wild, and it can be easily
re-introduced as xPartition = xJuxtapose_(xSelect, xReject)

BUG FIXES:

* xStopWatch no longer fails for named number inputs.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next for the tests must-all-be-indices, must-be-collection,
must-be-equal-length-to, must-be-flag, must-be-of-length macros.

* Added forall-next test for xShuffle, xSlice, xSortBy,	xSpread, xStopwatch,
xValuesOf.











Kea 0.30.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-5

Improved xAs* family of functions, labelling of higher-order-function errors, removed xMapply.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added clear labelling of errors and warnings thrown by
functions given to higher-order functions.

* Removed xMapply; despite being useful it was a compound of xMap and
xUnspread, and similar functions like xSelect don't have analogous compositions.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed an undeclared reference in 'check_regexp' try-catch.

* xAsRaw (and it's internal backend as_typed_vector ) now throws an error for NA
values, as NA's cannot be converted to raw.

* as_typed_vector (the backend to the xAs* functions) now correctly type-converts
vectors of only NA values to a target type.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed usage sections from methods, as they raised warnings.

* Added example for xPrepend.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Improved the efficiency of kea tests, allowing for many more test-cases
to be used in a given timespan.

* Added rigourous tests for atomic-vector handling by as_typed_vector.

* Removed benchmarks; kea will use branches for benchmarks in the future.











Kea 0.29.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-30

A major breaking update. Overhauls named-collection handling.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* xAtCol, xCycle, xDrop,
xDropWhile, xFlatMap, xInitOf, xMap, xMapply, xOrderOf,
xPartition, xRank, xReject, xRestOf, xReverse, xSelect,
xShuffle, xSlice, xSortBy, xTake, xTakeWhile, xUnzipIndices,
xWhere now preserve collection names, including for empty
collections.

* The element types within a list are now summarised by summate.

BUG FIXES:

* xIsNa (and internal NA checking tools) now return true for named NA values.

* checking if a value is a collection now false for factors.

* The parametre 'num' now checks and fails if its argument is Na.

* Summation of character-vectors now includes the number of NA values in
the input.

* Summation of incorrect arguments now corrently handles NA values in vectors.

* Infinite values are now included as whole numbers during argument summation.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Corrected type signature of xExplode.

* Added example for xPrepend.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next tests for xTake, xDrop, xFlatMap,
xGroupBy, xInitOf, xNotFalse, xRestOf, xReverse, xTabulate.

* is_na and elem_is_na is now true for named NA elements.

* Generators are now created using function composition,
for ease of writing. These will be optimised in the next
release.

* Updated tests to check for named length-zero corner-cases.

* Added a macro must_not_contain_nan.

* Removed unit_to_value.

* Named inputs are now used as test cases.

* as_typed_vector now handles named inputs correctly.

* Added worksWhen element to grammar, which tests if a program
executes without exception.

* Added internal functions to manipulate names.

* Omitted unneeded ::: calls in load_test_dependencies.

* Removed flotsam-calls test.








Kea 0.28.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-26

Improved handling of string corner-cases.

BUG FIXES:

* Incorrect arguments to 'rexp' parametre now throws a useful
error when it is not a collection.

* 'num' now checks and fails if its argument is NaN.

* Regular expressions are now validated before use, and throw
clear errors if invalid.

* Regular expressions throw a clear error if NA is provided.

* Arguments matching 'str', 'str1', and 'str2' may no longer be NA.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added macros must-be-non-na, must-be-non-nan, must-not-contain-na.

* Added function to validate regular expressions.








Kea 0.27.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-26

Improvements to numeric corner-cases, BUG FIXES, and speedups.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* xCompose no longer collects its arguments: this means that
xCompose_(identity) is now identical to identity.

* xOrderOf now returns indices that sort in increaing order, for
consistency with xSortBy.

* xOrderOf now throws an error for NA and NaN input, as they
are unorderable.

* xRank now throws an error for NA and NaN input, as they
are unorderable.

* xOrderOf is now faster.

BUG FIXES:

* fns parametre arguments now correctly reassigned after function lookup.

* Type conversion of any na to any other na is now allowed.

* xCycle now fails when trying to cycle infinitely far.

* xRepeat now throws a clear error when trying to repeat infinitely.

* Removed second, redundant type conversion from xAs* family of functions,
which should increase performance.

* xChoose no longer fails for length-zero numbers.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added must-be-finite, must-be-orderable macros.

* Added a forall-next test to xAt, xChoose, xCompose, xJuxtapose,
xNotNa, xIsNull, xOrderOf, xRank, xStopWatch, xThread.

* Renamed 'when' to 'holdsWhen'.

* Devectorised is_na.








Kea 0.26.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-24

Added two new functions, fixed a bug in input validation.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xIndicesOf, which that returns the indices of a collection.

* Added xKeysOf, which returns the names of a collection.

* Removed '%of%', one of two infix composition operators. Calls to
%then% are easier to read.

BUG FIXES:

* the parametre 'fns' ands 'colls' now correctly validates its input;
previously it did not check if its argument was a collection of functions
or function names.

* A temporary variable created by the must-be-collection-of-fn-matchable
macro is now hidden.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next tests for xIndicesOf.










Kea 0.25.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-20

Removed several functions, made partially applied function throw better error messages.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Partially-applied functions give a clearer call when they throw an error, showing
 the name of the kea function that threw the error.

* xAtKey now throws an error if the input collection does not contain the required
key, rather than returning NULL.

* Removed xPluck, as it was simply a vectorised form of xAtKey, with the same task
better achieved by xMap(xAtKey()).

* Removed xSplitAt and xSplitWith, as their corner cases are currently unclear
 and they are largely untested. Decatenation functions will be reintroduced
 at a later date, though probably in a different form.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a bug in xRead; multiple lines are now correctly collapsed with the
newline character.

* Functions with the parametre 'fns' now checks that 'fns' is a collection.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added a new macro for ensuring a collection's names contains a key.

* Added a forall-next test for xParamsOf.












Kea 0.24.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-18

Major internal update, changes corner-cases of most functions, removed two functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed xInter to xInterOf, for consistancy with xUnionOf.

* Removed xRecycle, as it is now possible to recycle with xRepeat, xMap and xTake easily.

* Removed xReorder, as xSlice and xMap can reorder easily.

* Functions that take a number or string now treat numeric(0) or string(0) in a similar
manner to how collection functions return the empty collection. Conceptually, these atomic
inputs are treated like values in a Maybe type.

This is more logical than the previous behaviour of converting empty numbers or strings
to length-one values, but there are likely bad corner cases introduced in this release that
will be ironed out in the future.

* xAnyOf, ..., xNoneOf, xSelect, xReject, xPartition, xDropWhile,
xTakeWhile, xPoll, xSplitWith now throws an error if a non-boolean result is given by
an input predicate.

BUG FIXES:

* xChop and xChunk now respond useful errors for NaN values.

* Functions that require collections no longer accept factors.

* xJuxtapose no longer has the insane corner-case of returning the empty list
when supplied no functions; it now returns a function as it originally should have.

* xImplode no longer excludes length-zero or empty strings
from its input collection.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Improved documentation of corner-cases.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Refactored macros into their own files; this should aid testing significantly.

* num, str...str2, rexp have their type-checking code automatically injected into
kea functions now.

* Added a forall-next test for xImplode












Kea 0.23.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-14

Improves arrow function, with speed improvements, BUG FIXES, new features.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Arrow functions now support underscore parametres; any parametre with an underscore
suffix is automatically made into a kea object, and the underscores are removed from the parametre.

* xLambda is no longer directly exported, as kea is not a metaprogramming library
and there are no tests validating it works when directly called.

* Improved the performance of arrow functions, particularily for unary functions with no
underscores.

BUG FIXES:

* Arrow functions now correctly displays where its errors were raised from.

* Fixed a typo in arrow function error message.

* Errors are now thrown for duplicated parametres before the function is invoked.

* Removed unneeded call to `sys.call` in xCompose, which should speed up generated
functions significantly.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added an example to xChunk.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added join_exprs, which joins two expressions into a single expression.












Kea 0.22.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-12

Improved performance of some functions significantly.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* To simplify code injection, factors now have the corresponding
parametre 'fact' and matrices/data-frames the parametre 'tab'.

* Removed filtering of no-character strings from xToWords, xToLines, xToChars,
to keep in line with xImplode's recent change. Leading whitespaces ARE
still removed, though this may be modified in the future.

* Speedup of xArityOf, xAsVar, xAsVal, xIsVal, xVal, xShuffle, xUnspread,
and the wildcard operators x. $ and x. @.

* Minor speedup of functions that call 'unit_to_value' or 'as_typed_vector'.

* Method lookup is now slightly quicker.

BUG FIXES:

* xIsVariadic of nullary functions is now logical(0), to be consistant
with other logical functions.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed a type of xToWords.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Simplified automatic precondition writing.

* The parametres nums, strs, ints, and bools now automatically inject
their boilerplate into their respective functions.

* Removed explicit use of strsplit, replacing it with str_split.

* Removed use of toString, for efficiencies sake now using paste.

* Added a forall-next test, testing if partial application works when
parametres are matched out-of-order.

* Added a forall-next test for xIsVariadic, xJoin.












Kea 0.21.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-11

An internal update, that adds automatic addition of argument-writing code.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Variadic functions are now more efficient.

BUG FIXES:

* x_ now adds a newline before printing.

* Fixed a name collision in partially applied functions that affected
functions with a 'fn' parametre.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* The Fix macro now injects argument-checking macros into a function
based on the parametre name, making it an ad-hoc type system.

* Removed most explicit calls to macro's from function definitions;
they are now automatically injected.

* Removed explicit function matching from functions with fn, pred or
fns parametres.

* Added forall-next test for partially-applied methods, xDropWhile,
xTakeWhile, xUnionOf, xWhere.

* Removed test for macros, since they are no longer written by hand.













Kea 0.20.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-10

Removed specialised reading/writing functions, adds xRead and xWrite.

Date: 2014-6-11

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xRead, which reads a file as a single string.

* Added xWrite, which writes a single string to a file.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Updated xAddKey examples to exploit partial application.













Kea 0.19.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-10

A minor update. Adds xLastAs, fixes a bug in xFirstAs...xFourthAs.

Date: 2014-6-10

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xLastAs, which sets the last value of a collection.

BUG FIXES:

* xFirstAs ... xFourthAs could not be correctly partially-applied. This is fixed, and
a future version of Kea will guard against these errors.

DOCUMENTATION:

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Updated the xVal test to work correctly with Rscript testing commands;
tests now run correctly from the command line.

* Added Rscript to run a single unit test.

* Added a forall-next test for xGroupBy, xLastAs.












Kea 0.18.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-9

Adds further support for automatic partial application, adds mutator
functions & removed some vectorised functions.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added automatic partial application to the variadic forms of functions.

* Added xAppend, xPrepend for inserting elements into a collection.

* Added xFirstAs, xSecondAs, xThirdAs, and xFourthAs. These functions set their
respective position in a collection to a value.

* xCycle no longer operates on collections of collections, instead on flat collections.
Partial application reduces the need for collection-of-collection functions, and simple
type signatures are more composable than complex ones.

* Removed xElemIs, xElemNot; partial application means that 'xMap(xIs(val))' works
perfectly well, eliminating the benefit of these functions.

* xExplode no longer removes length-zero elements produced on exploding; although
strsplit can introduce such elements spuriously, removing them can cause difficulties.
This may be addressed by not ussing strsplit internally in a future version.

* xFromChars, xFromWords, xFromLines no longer call xImplode internally, so error-messages
should be identified as coming from them, not xImplode.

DOCUMENTATION:

* xByRowKeys documentation now correctly builds.

* Removed embarassing use of the word 'automatical' from README.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Testing tools can now be run from the command line, with colourised output. Some
tests currently break when run in this mode.

* MakeVariadic now inserts the 'Fix' macro into its generated functions.

* Wrote forall-next tests for xCycle, xAppend, xPrepend, xFirstAs, xSecondAs,
xThirdAs, xFourthAs, xUniqueOf.












Kea 0.17.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-7

Adds automatic partial application to every function in Kea. No tests are
currently breaking, but this feature likely interferes with error reporting.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Kea functions are now partially-appliable; not all arguments need to be
provided at once. This is an important milestone. Errors are no longer thrown
for missing inputs for this reason.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a bug that crashed error handing due to improper conversion of a
function to a string during error message creation.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added fix, a variant of xFix required for efficient partial application of
internal functions.

* Added Fix, a macro added to functions that need to be partially applied.

* Fixed an incorrect definition of test_negative; now correctly applies case
to property.

* Removed test for the missing macro, since this is no longer needed.

* Added unit tests for xFirstOf, xFourthOf, xIsNan, xIsTrue, xList, xLocate,
xNotNan, xOneOf, xPoll, xReject, xSecondOf, xThirdOf, xUnit, xUnspread,
xUnzipIndices, and xUnzipKeys.

* Added inject_expr, which inserts a line into the head of an expression body.
Currenty untested.












Kea 0.16.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-7

A very minor update. Renamed library from it's working name (Arrow) to
a final name (Kea), refactored internals.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Removed non-ascii characters from documentation (lambda, epsilon).

* Renamed method-only function's title from $ xMethod to xMethod.

* Rewrote readme.

Package Internals

* Refactored forall-next to remove code duplication.

* forall-next now works correctly for negative tests.

* added additional tests for forall-next itself.

* added negative test to xAt.

* added tests to xChunk, xDo, xMap, xSelect.












Kea 0.15.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-5

This release adds some rigourous tests to kea, and fixes several bugs.

BUG FIXES:

* xChop called with Inf now returns a list of length-one lists, instead of
converting its input to a list.

* xNoneOf now detects whether not-any result was true, instead of not-any.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed a broken roxygen tag in xElemsByCols.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added forall-next tests for xAllOf, xAnyOf, xArityOf, xCapture, xChop,
xFalsity, xFirstOf, xIdentity, xIrrelevance, xIsEmpty, xIsFalse, xIsTrue,
xNoneOf, xNotEmpty, xPoll, xReject, xSecondOf, xTabulate, xThirdOf,
xTruth, xVersion, xZip and xZipKeys.












Kea 0.14.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-5

This version removes xVectorise and xGraft, and cleans up the method code.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xUnit_, a variadic form of xUnit.

* The method $ xExecute now passes its left-hand side self argument to its
anonymous function (the lambda was previous zero-argument).

* Removed xVectorise/xVectorize; future versions of Kea will include
automatic partial application (or at the very least pre-currying), so
vectorise will become redundant.

* Removed xGraft, which allowed custom methods to be added to the kea
call chain. It was untested, unusued, and barely more useful than xTap.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added missing parametre documentation for x__ (its ... argument).

BUG FIXES:

* xExecute & xTap now performs function lookup on its input function/string argument.
For example, xTap('mean') will now call xTap with the mean function.

* Fixed potential error in xByRows, xByCols for empty matrices/data.frames. Now returns
the empty list for that case.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Moved all functions only available as methods into their own files,
instead of having direct definitions in x_.R. This aids code uniformity & testing.

* forall-next can now take multiple descriptions, and has improved error reporting for
positive failures.

* changed describe from an overriding field to a joining field in the forall-next tools.

* factored prototype inheritance into a function.

* Removed errant in-prototype definitions of xThread; now uses the method-adding
function.

* added forall-next tests for x_

* renamed make_formals to as_formals, removed the 'as_parametres' alias for as_formals

* removed join-env, is_fn_matchable; neither was ever called by kea.












Kea 0.13.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-6-2

A mostly internal update, removes two quantifier functions and adds x__.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added x__, the variadic form of x_.

* Removed xExists and xForall; the addition of xAnyOf and xAnyOf is equivalent
for most cases, and for the remaining cases (polyadic functions) using xProdSetOf
and a quantifier is identical, and favours composition.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added examples to xAddKeys, xByLevels, xChoose, xElemNot, xIsMember, xNotTrue,

BUG FIXES:

* xOneOf now throws an error for an empty collection, as it is impossible to
return any elements in this case.

* Factors passed to x_ now get assigned the correct set of methods; previously
they were given collection methods, as factors are technically collections.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Seperated the next forall tool into modules, fixed several bugs. The tool is now
effective for simple test cases, but more work is required for negative tests.

* Added new-style tests to xIs, xNot, xOneOf.

* Simplified the '+.xforall' method with higher-order functions.











Kea 0.12.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-28

A major but mostly internal update; upgraded testing tools and removed dangerous
function calls.

A major but mostly internal update; upgraded testing tools and removed dangerous
function calls.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added 'all empty' and 'any empty' property tests to value summation for lists,
and dimension reporting for data frames.

* Added property tests for inner kea objects in summated lists.

* Removed special handling of NA's from xElemIs and xElemNot, but this may be
re-implemented in the future.

* Removed the x_ method from Kea, since x_Identity does the same thing
in a more obvious way.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed missing spaces in error messages produced by incorrectly typed vectors.

* Simplified behaviour of xIsNan, xNotNa, xNotNan, xIsNan, potentially
correcting issues for non length-one vectors.

* Removed use of sample, potetentially fixing bugs with numeric vectors.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added example for xElemIs, xLocate, xReadChars, xReadLines, xReadwords,
xRestOf, xParamsOf.

* Removed redundant @method tags from documentation.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added a rigourous test for example length, file existence, function calls
to dangerous functions, and for missing 'missing' functions, and removed an
older similar test suite.

* Implemented a new testing tool for Kea, which should give more complete
test coverage and both positive and negative controls. The syntax is also
improved. xSelect currently uses this tool exclusively, and its use will be
expanded in future versions.

* Added a simple test for the new forall tool, though more are needed.

* Removed direct use of is.na; the function can fail for null values, and
testing functions should never fail. Further testing functions will be wrapped
or removed at a later date.

* Removed direct use of sample, as the function has a bizzare corner case
for length-one number vectors.

* Added elem_is_na and elem_is_nan, to replace the use of is.na and
is.nan for vectors.

* Removed direct use of is.atomic and is.list, replacing them with functions that
fix their null corner case.

* Added a minor fix to ith_suffix corner case which now supports infinite
values, in the unlikely case they will arise.

* throw_kea_warning now actually throws a warning, not an error. The function
was not used, so no bug fixes are required.











Kea 0.11.0
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-19

Removes several data frame and matrix methods, and adds many examples.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Removed xColUnit, xRowUnit, xFullUnit. Although theoretically useful
they were largely untested and unused. May be added in future if genuinely needed.

* Removed xTranspose. Kea as a policy does not support matrices and data frames,
only their conversion to other types. There are effective ways to transpose lists
in Kea already.

BUG FIXES:

* Added xCapture alias xK to the methods avaiable to all values. More rigourous
tests will be added in future to avoid missing methods.

* xByColkeys & xByRowkeys for matrices now return character vectors.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Fixed type signature of xPluck, xRepeat.

* Added example to (or improved example for):
xAddKeys, xAllOf, xAsCharacter, xAsComplex,
xAsDouble, xAsInteger, xAsLogical, xCapture, xChunk, xDeepMap,
xDelay, xElemsByCols, xElemsByRows, xExecute, xFix, xFormalsOf,
xFromChars, xIsFalse, xIsMatch, xLift, xLocate, xMinBy, xNoneOf,
xNotEmpty, xNotFalse, xNotMembers, xNotNan, xNotNull, xPartition,
xShuffle, xSlice, xThread, xToChars, xUniqueOf,

* Added details to xByRows.

* Html-escaped docs for xToChars, xToLines, xToWords.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added tests for xIsSubset, xNotSubset.

* Added tests for xNegate.

* Added .babelignore, to allow easier random access of useful kea files.

* Added rsample, which corrects a bad length-one corner case in sample. Will
remove direct use of sample from kea in future. Bugs caused by sample may
come to light in the next release.











Kea 0.10.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-16

Removes the xElemIs*, xElemNot* and xReject* family of functions,
replacing them with the more generix xElemIs and xElemNot.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xElemIs and xElemNot. These functions test each element of a
collection for equality to a value.

* Renamed xIsNot to xNot, for consistency with the other predicate names
in Kea.

* Removed xElemIsFalse, xElemIsNa, xElemIsTrue, xElemNotFalse, xElemNotNa,
xElemNotTrue, xElemIsNull, xElemIsNan, xElemNotNan, xElemNotNull,
xRejectNa, xRejectNan, xRejectNull, xRejectEmpty. The rational for this
is that kea emphasises compositionality, and each case these functions solve
can easily be done with other functions. This reduces the number of tests and
documentation to be maintained significantly.

BUG FIXES:

* xByColkeys and xByRowkeys now return character vectors.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added large example to xFix.

* Clarified/corrected return values of xWrite* family of functions.

* Corrected type signatures of xMinBy and xMayBy.

* Corrected return value of xByColkeys.

* Clarified xFromChars' description.

* Added minor details to xIsMatch.

* Added example to xByCols and xByRows.

* Added example to xNotNa.

* Added example to xNotNan.

* Removed non-parsing example from xUnzipIndices.

* Added example to xUnzipIndices.

* Extended xUnit's example.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Removed unevaluated check for kea objects in one case
of as_typed_vector's if condition.

* Added test to xUnionOf.











Kea 0.9.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-12

This release adds xIsNot, improves documentation.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* added xIsNot, a complement to xIs.

* Improved error messages provided when converting vector types;
if an kea object is supplied (accidentally) this is stated.

* Implemented basic object summarisation for data frames (upon error).

BUG FIXES:

* xAtCol now attempts to container type-convert its numeric input "num".

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added details and corner cases to xAtCol.

* Added details to xUnzipIndices.

* Added corner cases section to xAsComplex, xAsCharacter.

* Clarified a corner case in xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* added fromStream, part of the testing tool in development.

* throw_kea_error can now be called without a call argument.

* forall will now correctly report errors; previously the argument order was backwards.












Kea 0.8.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-11

This release drastically improves the appearance of error messages.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* improved the appearance of error messages; they now take up less space.

* for error-causing lists, two new properties are displayed in the error:
'is nested' and 'all nested'.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* renamed propeties of summate to use whitespace instead of underscores.

* as_typed_vector and as_atom are now more documented, and slightly more efficient.

* refactored back end to remove older error-message containing like exclaim and lament,
in favour of in-place definitions.

* removed maybe_atomic & newline

* used as_parameters in MakeVariadic, to avoid code duplication.











Kea 0.7.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-10

A mostly internal release, renamed Any, xNone, to xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Renamed xAll, xAny, xNone, to xAllOf, xAnyOf, xNoneOf. This complies better
with Kea's naming conventions.

* Functions that require collections, functions, or collections of functions
will now inform the user if they were (accidentally) given an kea object.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added more accurate desciption to the xAs* family of container converters.

* Escaped most special characters in type signatures; html documentation will now
render correctly in most cases.

* Minor updates to the readme.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Deprecated and removed assert, moving over to the more flexible
functions throw_kea_error and throw_kea_warning.

* Added extensive tests for xUnzipIndices.

* Added test to ensure xJoin always returns a list.











Kea 0.6.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-7

Added xNotSubset, renamed xNot and removed xAsClosure.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xNotSubset, to complement the function xIsSubset.

* Renamed xNot to xNegate, to allow for a complement to be added to xIs.

* Removed xAsClosure; the function had very minimal likely use-cases,
and did not work for every primitive function.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Removed a lot of dead code (mostly error message code).

* Added tests to xElemIs_ functions.

* Made stringify_call more robust.

* Commented xList code extensively.












Kea 0.5.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

A feature-rich version; adds three new functions for testing equality
and match/mismatch against a regular expression.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xIs; a function for testing if values are identical.

* Added xIsMatch; tests if a string matches a regular expression.

* Added xNotMatch; tests if a string doesn't match a regular expression.

BUG FIXES:

* renamed xAddKeys... to xAddKeys_, to keep in step with other variadic
methods.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added example for xIs.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Added tests for xIs, xIsMatch, xNotMatch.











Kea 0.4.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-4

This version adds xNone and a logo, and fixes an important bug in error-reporting
functions (no irony whatsoever).

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Added xNone; the antonym of xAllOf. It completes the set of functions
xAllOf (does every element match a predicate?), xAnyOf (does any element match a predicate?)
and now xNone (does no value match a predicate?).

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed an issue in reporting of missing arguments (and possibly other exceptions). The
name of the argument for which an error is thrown is now displayed properly.

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added a prototype logo for Kea!

* Added details section to xMap, explaining the basic concept of map.

* Added details section to xVersion, explaining the semantic versioning standard.

* Added example for xLastOf.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* Fixed broken link tags in header of staticdocs head file.

* Added contact page (though jQuery) to staticdocs site.

* dQuote now lazily captures its argument.

* added tests for xNone.










Kea 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-3

A bug-fix release.

ENHANCEMENTS:

* Very slightly improved xProdSetOf's efficiency by changing an inner Map
to lapply.

BUG FIXES:

* Fixed a bug in as_method, in which variadic methods were not being generated
due to the use of an outdated regular expression to test whether the input function
was variadic.

* Type-errors in functions that take collections (xExplode for example) now report
the user-facing function they were thrown from.

* Fixed corner-case for xOneOf; if given a length one vector it extracts the value
from its collection (if it is a list).

DOCUMENTATION:

* Added most missing type signatures to function docs.
* Added several missing titles to function docs.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* as_atom and as_typed_vector now use the parent call
(sys.call(-1)) in error reports.

* Added test to check that every function has a type signature and title.











Kea 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-5-2

A minor release, mostly housekeeping and repaying technical debt.

BUG FIXES:

* the xAsComplex, xAsInteger... family of functions now support conversion
of lists that contain NA values of any mode, at the cost of some performance.

* xLambda now checks that ':' is used as a parametre delimiter;
previously several infix functions could be used.

DOCUMENTATION:

* type signatures added to several more function's documentation.

PACKAGE INTERNALS:

* internal function `MakeVariadic` used to generate variadic forms of
functions, which should help avoid bugs in their definitions.

* eliminated most error-message functions, in favour of in-place
definitions and macros. This removed a lot of unneeded code.

* internal function `unit_to_value` now supports complex values.










Kea 0.1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2014-4-30

The initial release of Kea. A highly experimental release, and ideally not
the version the public will see.
